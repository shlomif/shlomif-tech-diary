Hi! Thanks for the reply! I may be wrong (but see http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/ - you might be too, or we both may be).

First of all, note that my noscript config was blocking giphy there. That put aside, the discussion there seems pointless ("Emma was hot/sexy!" - it is true, but is not insightful: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=paul-graham-news-that-are-not-news .)

This reminds me of the [reddit discussion of a tech article/essay/report I shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/freebsd/comments/9ncmrs/what_i_learned_from_porting_my_projects_to_freebsd/) which was more content-free than the [hn one](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18318771).

If we take my [Emma Watson factoids page](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/) (similar to Chuck Norris facts), then while they are satirical (and sometimes oversexualised or cringeworthy to some), they are thought provoking and may advance the philosophical state of those who read them.

Furthermore, I have some [longer](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/) and [shorter](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/) screenplays which are "fanfic" (not that Hollywood isn't fanficcing as well) and where I wish her to be featured.

Feel free to quote this entire reply, but I'm not planning on sharing it for now.

Just my 2 cents. ( I realise I may be [self-indulged](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/asperger_syndrome.xhtml) - it's a known bug/feature/misfeature of my net persona. )
