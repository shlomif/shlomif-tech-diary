“So, who the Hell is Qoheleth?” - An Illustrated Screenplay

Hi all,

I'd be happy to read commentary about "“So, who the Hell is Qoheleth?” -
An Illustrated Screenplay":

[[[

Josephus was a budding philosopher of Jewish descent in Damascus of Hellenistic
times, when he took a bet that he could produce a decent work of philosophy,
and wrote the Biblical scroll of Ecclesiastes (Qoheleth). Soon after that, he
became the most notorious celebrity in his town, made a moderate fortune from
donations of enthusiastic fans of the scroll, and became annoyed by the fact
that he has become the object of affection of nearly every single young female
in his town.

However, nothing could prepare Josephus to the day he ran into a trio of female
Celtic travellers, who provide him with many questions, including the million
dollar question, “Who is the Qoheleth (Now)?”.

This is an illustrated screenplay inspired by the #SummerNSA effort and set in
a time of great confusion — not unlike our own, while containing some
anachronisms.
