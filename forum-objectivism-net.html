<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>my name is Shlomi Fish (or שלומי פיש in the Hebrew alphabet), and I&#39;m a (male) writer (of both fiction and non-fiction) and software developer, raised and living in Tel Aviv, Israel. You can learn more about me and see the various online resources that I created on <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">my home-site</a>.</p>
<p>I have written <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">several works of fiction and humour</a> inspired by Objectivism and many other sources of influence and published them on my personal web site, under Creative Commons licences. Among them I can mention:</p>

<ol>

<li><a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOWTF/">The One with the Fountainhead</a> - a two-part episode of the television show Friends that parodies and modernises Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. Was read and enjoyed in the past by people who were not familiar with the show.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">The Enemy and How I Helped to Fight it</a> - my first substantial novella, this is a surrealistic political satire of Middle Eastern national politics written from the perspective of an Objectivist.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/">The Human Hacking Field Guide</a> - a story about several teenagers in the vicinity of 2005 Los Angeles who extensively deal with open source hacking, as well as their love lives, and reflections about various aspects of popular culture. While emulating commercially produced stories for adolescent girls in form, it was liked by many people who now despise the genre, and it is the closest story to resembling romanticist realism, that I have ever written.</li>

</ol>

<p>
I also have my own Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode there, and a <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/">parody and reflection upon Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> titled “Selina Mandrake - The Slayer” (though they both share many concepts from my personal associations and crazy imagination), and they both also reflect my personal philosophy.
</p>

<p>
I should note that I don't think philosophy has reached its natural end in Ayn Rand (or that she was the Omega) and have been constantly inspired by many other ideas and idea systems, both old and new, and both real and fictional. I call my current philosophy “Rindolfism”, after
</p>
