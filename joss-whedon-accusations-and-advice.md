Regarding the accusations of Joss Whedon being abusive and offending the women
on his sets, I think it was a side effect of the fact that after ~1999-2000, the
"web 2.0"/open content trend was in place, and more and more geeky and hackery
wannabe screenwriters or writers, got their feet wet with learning HTML,
software dev, graphics editing, etc. and publishing online.

( I suspect he was also abusive to the men there, but they tended to have thicker
skin and be less emotional than the women, which made the interactions
escalate less. )

Furthermore, given the trend toward "open / free / share / remix"
culture ( ["I thought using loops was cheating"](https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/60zh48/do_you_ever_feel_like_your_cheating_by_using/dfasidh/) )
more and more have been writing fanfiction including [crossovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_28fiction%29), parodies, and even [Real Person Fiction (RPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction): often at the same time!

Worse: older, experienced, and/or acclaimed screenwriters, have also met enough
inspirers to convert to "the dark side" and start thinking and writing in terms
of such fanfic and cannot be bothered to massage it into Hollywood's draconian,
finicky and yet - boring (no images, embedded YouTube/etc. videos, hyperlinks, emoji,
etc.) format. "ageism" works both ways: WhatsApp and Instagram were bought by
facebook because it was believed children avoided facebook.com because
their parents were there, but parents were smart enough to learn Instagram
and WhatsApp, and children and parents increasingly know to not be intimidated
by each other's competence.

Anyway, we can imagine a 10 years old child writing an informal screenplay
using Google Docs,
where [Emma Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Watson)
and [Kim Kardashian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian) fight
for who gets to ride [Princess Celestia](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_Celestia)
next, with [Darth Vader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader)
and [Haman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haman) as two "evil" (but mutually
resenting one another) arbitrators . Yes, it will be a legal
and "ethical" minefield, but I'd bet it'd be easier to follow and more
entertaining than [Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings)
was even shortly after it was written.

This has several implications:

1. Screenplays are not getting written in Hollywood's blessed format.

2. They are increasingly crossovers/parodies/RPFs.

3. Screenwriters do not mind their peers taking their works in their own
direction, but won't mutate them on their own initiative even for all the money in the world (being geeks aka [amateurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur) who wish to enjoy their work).

4. The situation won't get better.

I think both Joss and his (past and/or future) employees will be happier
producing commercial fanfics in this day and age when even Cookie Monster
endorses the sharing culture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCeMZccDMA0 .
"Be excellent to each other [including to these who were not 100% kind
to you.]."

I have a plan to "hack" forward commercial fanfiction into the mainstream film industry, but note that like [The Seldon Plan](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/changing-the-seldon-plan/), I expect it will require some modifications and improvisation along the way: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/ .
