Dear foodstirs.com,

please forward this message to Ms. Sarah Michelle Gellar-Prinze (or
otherwise let me know why you chose not to.). It is not directly
related to foodstirs but I found the link on https://twitter.com/SarahMGellar
and she doesn't seem too responsive on social media sites.

Hi Sarah Michelle,

I'd like to interest you in my plan to heal the film and fiction industries
and help heal the world in general - all while improving yourself,
enjoying yourself, and possibly becoming richer and more famous. I hope
you'll reply back using my contact infos: https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/ this time.

Anyway, you can read my mission statement here:

https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/

"Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as geeky
imperatives (as of 2021)"

"Let's make (fan)-fiction great again!"

(Essay which consists of mini essays embellished with quotes, image memes, and
embedded youtube videos; CC-by licence)

As I note, there is a shift of attractive ("beautiful", "hot", etc.) and/or
skillful and competent people (of any age, gender, and past experience)
increasingly being both geeky (= "amateur", loving their work and endeavour)
and "hackers" (= action heroes, rule benders, resourceful, defying their fate).
Moreover, not only the alphas, but have become the mainstream and majority.
Combined with the open / free / share / remix / "steal" trend (open source,
open content, web 2.0, user-generated content, generosity, etc.), it makes most
screenwriters not bother massaging their screenplays into the Hollywood format,
and worse - write their screenplays as crossovers, real person fiction, and
parodies - including of recently created commercial and "all rights reserved"
works and franchises, and living and relatively young real-world people.

Moreover, most geeky and attractive actors (from Emma Watson or the 2021
Natalie Portman or the 2021 Jack Black, Chuck Norris, or you, to
most good-looking waiters or waitresses in Los Angeles) will refuse playing in
non-geeky/hacky screenplays, even for all the money in the world.

I give a plan for the way forward to break this "vicious" cycle, but note
that like the Seldon Plan, may require some ammendments and improvisations,
and likely won't be the final challenge faced by the film industry and humanity
as a whole.

I'm a big fan of some of your work (Buffy, and the Spiderman and LotR parodies)
and consider you my "biggest celebrity
crush" and a huge source of inspiration and a role model, and suggest you start producing
quality fanfic screenplays (whether yours, mine, or others) and I can help
you by dedicating time and energy (since I'm not rich yet, I can only offer
so little money that no "big name" film star will bother getting out of bed -
hah! Just kidding.)

Regarding the accusations of Joss Whedon being abusive and offending the women
on his set, I think it was a side effect of the fact that after ~1999-2000, the
"web 2.0"/open content trend was in place, and more and more geeky and hackery
wannabe screenwriters or writers, got their feet wet with learning HTML,
software dev, graphics editing, etc. and publishing online.

Furthermore, given the trend toward "open / free / share / remix"
culture ( ["I thought using loops was cheating"](https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/60zh48/do_you_ever_feel_like_your_cheating_by_using/dfasidh/)
more and more have been writing fanfiction including [crossovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_28fiction%29), parodies, and even [Real Person Fiction (RPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction): often at the same time!

Worse: older, experienced, and/or acclaimed screenwriters, have also met enough
inspirers to convert to "the dark side" and start thinking and writing in terms
of such fanfic and cannot be bothered to massage it into Hollywood's draconian,
finicky and yet - boring (no images, embedded YouTube videos, links, emoji,
etc.) format. "ageism" works both ways: WhatsApp and Instagram were bought by
facebook.com because it was believed children avoided facebook.com because
their parents were there, but parents were smart enough to learn Instagram
and WhatsApp, and children and parents increasingly know to not be intimidated
by each other's competence.

Anyway, we can imagine a 10 years old child writing an informal screenplay

Moreover, BtVS
stopped being broadcast in Israel, and made some unfortunate plot decisions.

Perhaps he was also abusive to the men there, but they tended to have thicker
skin and be less emotional than the women, which made the interactions
escalate less.

I think both Joss and his (past and/or future) employees will be happier
producing commercial fanfics in this day and age when even Cookie Monster
endorses the sharing culture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCeMZccDMA0 .
"Be excellent to each other [including to these who were not 100% kind
to you.]."

Happy upcoming Passover, Easter, etc.
