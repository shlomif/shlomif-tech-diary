<h2>2009-06-29: Introducing CPANHQ</h2>

<p>
Most people who are actively developing using Perl are familiar with
sites for searching CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network)
such as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a>
and <a href="http://kobesearch.cpan.org/">kobesearch.cpan.org</a>.
These sites provide a simple search bar where users can search for keywords
or key phrases, and find a list of results. These sites also feature
pages for the various CPAN distributions, the various authors, and the
individual pages of documentation inside the modules.
</p>

<p>
Recently, Andy Lester started the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rethinking-cpan">"Rethinking
CPAN" mailing list</a> and wrote <a
href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/04/rethinking-the-interface-to-cpan.html">a
Perlbuzz post titled "Rethinking the interface to CPAN"</a>, where he gave
the case that the current resources may be inadequate for the process
of selecting a module on CPAN. For a long time, there was an intermittent
discussion and some brain-storming, but very little code (if any) has been
written. This has all changed with
<a href="http://github.com/bricas/cpanhq/tree/master">CPANHQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
So what is CPANHQ? As documented in
<a href="http://wiki.github.com/bricas/cpanhq">the first
and only wiki page it has so far</a> (which I wrote a few days ago),
"CPANHQ aims to be a community-driven, meta-data-enhanced alternative to
such sites as <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a>
and <a href="http://kobesearch.cpan.org/">http://kobesearch.cpan.org/</a>.
Currently, the functionality is very basic, but we have great ambitions."
</p>

<p>
I learned about CPANHQ by overhearing a conversation on Freenode's #perl
channel. I joined the effort, and made several enhancements to the
<a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a> and
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?dbix_class">DBIx-Class</a>-based
code. The functionality is still very basic.
</p>

<p>
Some of the plans and ideas we have for CPANHQ, which may be translated into
code in the future are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
The code is and will remain open-source, which makes it easy for people to
contribute to.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
We plan to have most of the current features of search.cpan.org and
kobesearch.cpan.org including pages for authors, distributions, and individual
modules and their documentation.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
CPANHQ was already enhanced with some <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> JavaScript
goodness, and we plan to add more of it to make the user experience better.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The site aims to be more integrated than the many separate CPAN-related
sites today: search.cpan.org, CPAN Forum, AnnoCPAN, CPAN Ratings, CPANTS,
CPAN Dependencies, etc. By putting everything under one roof, we can provide
a better user experience than the many sites with very loose integration.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
We plan to enhance the site based on meta-data as provided by both the module
authors (in the <tt>META.yml</tt> file and the users of the site.
</p>

<p>
For example, we have already added support for the <a
href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec.html#keywords">META.yml's
keywords</a> which allow authors to tag modules, and we plan to support
user-tags too.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
CPANHQ will be very community-driven. People would be able to open user
accounts there, which will allow them to contribute content to the site,
such as tags/labels, comments, wiki pages, chatter, etc.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
The <a href="http://wiki.github.com/bricas/cpanhq">CPANHQ wiki page</a>
contains more ideas and insights. Like I said, the current functionality is
incredibly basic, but we hope that with enough help, time and dedication,
we can create an attractive and engaging interface to CPAN, to make
finding a module on CPAN faster, easier and more fun.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, you can look at the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/CPANHQ/screenshots/">screenshots</a>
we have of the interface so far, or clone the <a
href="http://github.com/bricas/cpanhq/tree/master">github repositories</a>,
and set up a local web-interface.
