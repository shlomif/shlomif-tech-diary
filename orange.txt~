"amazing"? By this do you mean full of non-portable bells and whistles,
and other idiosyncracies? Sorry, but that's not an amazing web-site
according to my book.

A good web-site is either simple and clean, or includes
standard-compliant, portable embelishments. (which are usually not
necessary).

Usability, low bandwidth, etc. is much more important than "amazingness"
and I bet it's not very usable in MSIE either.

Why does it? Why should it? I maintain a few web-sites in my free time and
I'm not getting paid to do so. If you keep your web-site clean and simple,
it will cost less money to maintain and will also attract more visitors.

I seriously doubt it is built according to anyone's business needs. Why do
you need JavaScript to display the catalog of images? Why not simply
include them in the HTML? If you look at popular international sites,
you'll see that most of them are built with simple and clean HTML
(sometimes without any trace of JavaScript).

1. It is possible.

2. I'm not talking about a separate version for other browsers. I'm
talking about one version for _all_ browsers.

It is cost efficient if you hire clueful developers. Look at my site:

http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/

(which links to other sites I made).

They all look perfectly fine in all modern browsers, including lynx (a
minimalistic text browser). Why? Because I know what I'm doing and I know
how to write good HTML.

First you tell me your site costs a lot of money to maintain, and then you
tell me it is not cost efficient to support other browsers. Now, let me
tell you this: if you keep your site clean and standards compliant, you
can have it support all browsers and it will cost you much less money to
maintain.

An apple a day will keep a doctor away. Two apples a day will keep two
doctors away.
