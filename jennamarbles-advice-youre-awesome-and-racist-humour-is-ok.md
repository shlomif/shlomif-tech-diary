I didn't realise how much I liked JennaMarbles until she removed a large number of her YouTube videos. ( Granted, I didn't like each and every one, but every creator had their low points. ) Anyway, given part of my responsibility as a ["warrior king"](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs) is to make sure no fellow person is unnecessarily unhappy, I'd like to say that to Jenna:

1. You're awesome. [Everyone is.](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#all_people_are_good)

2. "Racist" humour does not make you racist: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/are_you_a_sexist__are_you_a_feminist.xhtml . There were far graver atrocities described in the Bible (e.g: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levite%27s_concubine ; admittedly most scholars believe they were common in Biblical times) and generations of children and adults knew better than to emulate them, despite being taught the Bible should be taken as gospel (also see Jenna's ["What kid shows taught me?"](https://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/What%20Kid%20Shows%20Taught%20Me-ROZjaxT_0Hw.webm) ).

Joking about stereotypes is "good for business" and people who complain are being petty and paranoid. [You don't have to do what you think you must](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#do_and_let_do__live_and_let_live) .
