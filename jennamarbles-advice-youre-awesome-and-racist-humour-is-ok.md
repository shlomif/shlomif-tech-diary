I didn't realise how much I liked JennaMarbles until she removed a large number of her YouTube videos. ( Granted, I didn't like each and every one, but every creator had their low points. ) Anyway, I am a "warrior king", which is "a messiah", a world healer/advancer, a keeper of the faith - now one of a growing number of women and men of any age and a role I encourage everyone to undertake. See [this link](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs) for more info. As such it is my responsibility to make sure no fellow person is unnecessarily unhappy, so I'd like to say this to Jenna:

First of all: you're awesome. Everyone is. All people are good and awesome and can become more and more competent and benevolent. ( [Reference](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#all_people_are_good) ).

Secondly, "Racist" humour does not make you racist: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/are_you_a_sexist__are_you_a_feminist.xhtml . There were far graver atrocities described in the Bible . E.g: the story of [Levite's concubine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levite%27s_concubine) where they kill the entire Tribe of Benjamin except for 600 males, who are given brides by masacaring a different city. (Admittedly most scholars believe such acts were common in Biblical times). Nonetheless, generations of children and adults knew better than to emulate them, despite often being told the Bible should be taken as gospel (also see Jenna's ["What kid shows taught me"](https://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/What%20Kid%20Shows%20Taught%20Me-ROZjaxT_0Hw.webm) ).

Joking about stereotypes is "good for business" and people who complain are
being petty and paranoid. There is a freedom of speech and expression.

( Do note that I think the Bible has a lot of good stuff, but to quote Jonah 4:
«You took pity on the kikayon, for which you did not toil nor did you make it grow, which one night came into being and the next night perished. Now should I not take pity on Nineveh, the great city, in which there are many more than one hundred twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left, and many beasts as well?» ( https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16186/jewish/Chapter-4.htm )

Finally, realise that "you don't absolutely have to do what you think you must" ( [Reference](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#do_and_let_do__live_and_let_live) ) . I'm not a qualified psychotherapist, but I think it's the simple key to getting out of a [clinical depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) , and I'm offering you this advice for free.
