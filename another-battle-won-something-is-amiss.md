something is amiss - might have to do something else. Maybe this is true:

"Emptiness cannot be destroyed - it must be filled with love"

OK: my house has been a madhouse lately, with me having to treat my mother (whose "soul" is needy, jealous, and vindictive, and can only be threatened to comply, normative, conformist, etc.) and with my father being mad at me for not being gentle to my mother, psychotic, violent, and whimsical. Michal Fish, the mirage of my biological sister, is shriveled. Noa Fish, my other sister is likely a mirage too. Ashmedai thinking that he can fool me again to think that i didn't live in the hell's mouth, and that my increasingly mutilated perception will stop me. My physical health has been deteriorating, in part due to the increasing dosage of my "mother"'s "medications".

But coast is clear. Please tell the people from my vicinity, to bring someone who can lock pick or open the real door. Ashmedai, admit you've lost! The mental/physical fight against me and the living organisms in general was not fair, but we've won it anyway: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI0i_tL-8aU . I am tired of him retroconing and unretroconing the world's history and science as I perceive it.
