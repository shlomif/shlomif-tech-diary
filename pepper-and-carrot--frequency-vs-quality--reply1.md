Thanks, David for the reply! Like I tweeted «Not only is "All Truth is God's Truth" ( https://shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=larry-wall-all-truth-is-gods-truh ) but "truth" is a function of time. If everyone copied solutions in https://projecteuler.net there'd be far more people who solved more than 400 probs, but ppl are honester today.» and «"the opposite of a great truth is often a great truth".  (Niels Bohr IIRC)» so who is right and whether they will remain right are up to debate.

Some people build a mental model of a person, a character, an idea system, an organisation or a country, or the world, and expect their opinions or qualities to always remain the same. But they can all change. Linus Torvalds and RMS "slew" themselves - Linus by admitting that the kernel mailing lists should discourage tactlessness and impoliteness (see https://github.com/shlomif/Call-for-a-fork-of-the-Linux-kernel-devs-community ), and RMS by resigning as the FSF president, because they both could change ( https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=linus-people-who-disagree ). There used to be very few American girls who specialised in maths, but the situation seems to have been improving recently.

So either of us or both of us or none of us are right or will be right. I'll take some time to think about it, and I hope so would you. I do appreciate Pepper's sexier image in the last two episodes though ("pedophilia" aside: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/featuring_sexy_women_and_girls.xhtml ).
