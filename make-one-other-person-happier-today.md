Make one other person happier today

The Jewish Oral Torah said: «He who saved one soul, has essentially saved the world entire.», but you can do a little less than that. Make one other person, besides you, a little happier every day, and it can be with a very small gesture: tell a joke, strike a conversation, buy something from a shop, tell them you like the way they look or what they wear, or tell them you tend to agree with their insights.

Brighten up their (and yours) day.

“Carpe diem” is not about affecting the largest possible number of people (e.g: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism ), it is about leading a happy and full life: http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/images/carpe-diem-mofo.jpg .
