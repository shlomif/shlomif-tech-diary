<h2>What I've been Working on Lately</h2>

<p>
One of the advantages of being unemployed is that I can afford to work
on open-source projects a lot. Lately, I've been working on quite a few Perl
projects. The first one worth mentioning is
<a href="http://perlbuzz.com/2009/07/introducing-cpanhq.html">CPANHQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
Essentially CPANHQ aims to be an open-source, unified, meta-data-enhanced, and
community-driven interface to CPAN. At the moment, we have little to show for,
but we've been making progress. CPANHQ was my chance to finally get my feet
wet with <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a> and
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?dbix_class">DBIx-Class</a>,
and they both seem pretty nice so far.
</p>

<p>
I also did some work on <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/File-Find-Object/">File-Find-Object and File-Find-Object-Rule</a>.
In case, you don't know, File-Find-Object is an object-oriented alternative to
the core File::Find module that can be instantiated, has an
iterative/incremental interface and can return result objects.
File-Find-Object-Rule is a port of File-Find-Rule to use File-Find-Object
instead of File::Find, and lately, I've made its <tt>-&gt;start()</tt> and
<tt>-&gt;match()</tt> methods truly iterative instead of using
<tt>-&gt;in()</tt> which just collected all the results into one humongous
array and kept shifting stuff from it. This was a severe misfeature of
File-Find-Rule, IMO, and was caused by the limitations of File::Find.
</p>

<p>
Lately, in order to test the extension mechanism, I ported
File-Find-Rule-MMagic to File-Find-Object-Rule as
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Find-Object-Rule-MMagic/">File-Find-Object-Rule-MMagic</a>.
The porting turned out an incompatibility in the handling of the <tt>$_</tt>
variable in F-F-O-R and F-F-R. This is caused by the fact that
File-Find-Object does not change the working directory to the inner
directories in the tree like File::Find does. As a result, an internal
behaviour of File::Find
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html">leaked</a>
to File-Find-Rule and forced an incompatibility.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I've done was some cosmetic work on the Build.PL files of
some my CPAN distributions. Namely, I added some links to resources and
keywords (that can also be thought of as tags or labels) as specified in
<a href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec.html">the
META.yml spec</a>.
</p>

<p>
Resources are displayed in the distributions' pages on search.cpan.org and
other sites. Author keywords (when they exist, and very few have been defined)
are currently under-utilised. However, I recently added some rudimentary
support for them in CPANHQ (see above), and I hope that they will soon become
more popular.
</p>

<p>
A different aspect of my cleanup was clarifying the licensing terms of the
distributions. My original distributions are under the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT/X11 licence</a>,
but I wrote "All rights reserved" there as well, which I was told was
incompatible with it (or with <a
href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/04/the-problem-with-same-terms-as-perl-licensing.html">"the
same terms as Perl" licensing</a> for that matter). I
also added a COPYING file where appropriate.
</p>

<p>
I've finished reading <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596527242/">Mastering
Perl by brian d foy</a>. I read it by "fork"ing its GitHub repository,
reading the PODs and making some corrections in the process.
After I pushed my changes to my GitHub repository, and made a pull
request, brian d foy pulled the changes.
</p>

<p>
I wrote <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#mastering_perl">a
review of the book on my homepage</a>. Like I said there, the book did not
teach me too many new things, but I felt it was nonetheless accurate,
interesting and a good read for less experienced programmers. Maybe it means
I have already mostly "mastered" Perl 5.
</p>

<p>
I did some other work on the CPAN modules that I maintain. See
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~shlomif/?R=D">the CPAN listing of my
modules ordered by date</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
Recently an IRC friend of mine and I started working on our own project
from scratch, also using Catalyst and DBIx::Class. As a result, I'm learning
even more about them now. The project is currently in its infancy, but we
both agreed we are going to license it under the MIT/X11 Licence because we
both like it.
</p>

<p>
As a result of experimenting with various Perl-based technologies, I've
been building many <a
href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/packages/Mandriva/Cooker/SRPMS/">CPAN
distributions as RPM packages</a> on my
<a href="http://www2.mandriva.com/">Mandriva Linux</a> system. I found
this small Bash function useful:
</p>
<pre>
function up() { urpmi "perl($1)" ; }
</pre>

<p>
So I can say "<tt>up MyModule::Sub</tt>" and it will install the package
containing the Perl package "MyModule::Sub".
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, building the packages was straightforward, but often I needed to
apply some patches to the build's .spec or the module's tests. You can find
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/packages/Mandriva/Cooker/SRPMS/">the results on my homepage</a>
</p>

<p>
On the non-Perl related (but still open-source) front, I've been working on
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a>,
which is an ANSI C library to solve certain variants of card solitaire. I
released a stable version only to discover its build process was severely
broken (especially on Windows), so I had to release a x.y.1 release. Since
then, the Subversion trunk has acquired some other changes, and I'm trying
to see when I could get some time to work on two substantial changes that
I have in mind.
