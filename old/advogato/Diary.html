<p><b>BitKeeper Cont.</b>

<p>
All hell broke lose! I accidently misinterpreted what Larry McVoy said
about a mailing list to discuss the BK license and started one especially
for the cause on Yahoo Groups. I then was told it was a bad idea 
(by someone else) and so closed it and sent Larry my sincere apologies.

<p>
But who is John Galt? I mean: I like Larry, but I don't like his attitude.


<p><b>The Ultimate Choice</b>

<p>
The ultimate choice between good and bad lies in the mind of every man. This
ultimate choice is not between being productive or being unproductive (Ethics 
can be summed up in "First, do not harm"). It is between not harming anyone 
and destroying people's life and happiness.

<p>
Linus Torvalds chose good. He himself says that people should do less for ideals
and more for the fun of it: do and let do. Ideals are important. But inhabiting
the occupied territories is not an ideal. Honesty is. Constant Mental Effort is.
Integrated Thinking is. Sincerity is. Passion is.

<p>
Joel Spolsky chose good. He may not distribute his software as open-source, but
I would not do it either if I were him. You don't want FogBUGZ ? Use bugzilla 
instead. Don't like CityDesk? Use WebMetaLanguage (I do) or start hacking on 
your own. I am beginning to really like Shrinkwrap software (which includes 
open-source.) It makes you feel like you think about your users every day,
and produces code of high quality.

<p>
I did Internal software here and there. (even the autoconf scripts of 
open-source packages are considered internal software) Internal is something
more like let's run it until it breaks. Embedded seems fun and challenging.

<p>
Eric S. Raymond naturally is one of the most prominent value producers of our
time. His CatB series is nothing short of seminal, and a must read for everybody
whether you are a programmer or not.

<p>
Believe it or not but I think RMS is also a supreme value producer that is 
growing in happiness. He has a tendency to be stubburn and make everybody 
miserable, but otherwise he is doing great. At the moment, he deals with
legal hacks, which are much more important than adding a new feature to 
gcc. Everybody depends on the GPL keeping its edge. So, if he has to 
make sure this is the case - so be it.

<p><b>Life as a big riddle</b>

<p>
I m,any times, like to think of life here on earth as one big riddle that I have
to solve, after which the curtain falls, everybody congratulates me and I 
get to live happily ever after. I told it to one of the admins on Com-Net 
one night when I was in a philosophical mood.

<p>
I think people who does not see life like this are actually doing themselves 
damage. I mean, this is what ESR is all about (a social hacker), and Linus
and everybody. Common, gentle people who are holding a lot of power in 
their fingertips, all because they like to play with the elements of 
"existence".

<p>
But who is John Galt? (tartei-mashmah)

<b>Some Messages</b>

<p>
1. Dear people: will you please stop blaming others for your own
problems? I am not the worst among you - I am the best. If my productivity
and enthusiasm puts you in a bad light - that's not my problem. 

<p>
2. Someone criticized me for being tact-less. Then he sent me a series
of E-mails that were irrational, emotional, harsh and scared me to death.
Calling them tact-less would have been an understatement.

<p>
I don't remember me <b>that</b> tactless. People, you need to practice what
you preach.

<p>
3. I think the standard third-voice/diminishing of self trend is Evil. I like
to tell about myself and what I do, because I know that people will relate 
to a real-life developer who has real-life needs. It has nothing to do with
Ego-mania, so please give me a break.

<p>
Note that believing in Ego-diminishing fads can, IMO, have disastrous 
side-effects on your psychology. I remember the time that I tried very much to 
be humble. Didn't work at all. Now I'm proud and occasionally tell people about
things I do and what I did. I hope I'm not too arrogant, but that's life.
