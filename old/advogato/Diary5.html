<p><b>Web-site Changes</b></p>

<p>
I changed the "back to my homepage" image hover style to define
a background color so it will be entirely highlighted when the cursor
is on it. Then I did a CSS2 trick, and changed the a:hover style
inside the navigation bar to orange so it will look better with
the yellowish-green background. Konqueror and Mozilla process it
fine and so should MSIE too. (albeit I noticed IE indents the
navigation menu, which I don't understand why it should do so)
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, I downloaded gif2png and converted the "Back to my Homepage"
image from GIF to PNG. It went very smoothly and kept the transparency
and HTML behaviour fine. I then modified the WML template to refer to it
instead of the GIF. This is one step towards a GIF-free site. I don't think
Unisys can tyrannize Israeli-hosted sites, but it would make the site more
globally-friendly and can be thought of as a step towards solidarity with the
countries in which it does have a patent.

<p><b>Job Hunting</b></p>

<p>
I received a message from my IBM contact person that they are only looking
for students with higher grades, and it's a management policy. Hmmppf. He said
that from what he saw in my C.V. and on my homepage, I was very suitable,
but the management was deterred by my relatively low grades. But who is John
Galt?
</p>

<p>
Leah at Harmonic told me that momentarily they are not looking for employees,
whether students or full engineers, so I can't work there either. I have yet
to hear from Mercury, and have sent my C.V. to Raz systems, which may be
able to offer me a part time job or commission a few projects to me. It's
still too early to give up.
</p>

<p><b>Technion Connectivity</b></p>

<p>
Connectivity to the Technion is sporadic. Sometimes it works wonderfully;
sometimes it does not work at all; sometimes it is very slow. The 012.net guys
told me it had to do with the Technion. And strangely enough, the huji.ac.il
domain works perfectly all the time. Very strange. And my iglu.org.il account
at actcom seems to encounter the same problems the same time my home
workstation does.
</p>

<p>
Something is wrong with the Technion's configuration.
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I finished covering ESR's CatB in the "Solving - Origins and Orientation"
lecture. But I cannot upload it to vipe because of temporary Technion
connectivity problems. And I don't have my technion E-mail accounts either.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a lot of E-mails and there's an active discussion on Hackers-IL now
about what "software engineer" and "software engineering" means. I like it when there is an activity like that. I asked some questions of Linux-IL, but so
far received very few useful answers.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I added a few terms to the Terminology in the FCS arch doc, fixed
the TODO file a bit, and wrote a message on how it measures against the Joel
Test.
