<p><b>Subversion</b></p>

<p>
The day before yesterday I wrestled with two Subversion problems. The first
one was that whenever I tried to check a file out of an https:// mounted
directory, I got a strange OpenSSL-error report. An old version of Subversion
worked perfectly fine. It turned out to be a problem that the WebDAV library
was not compiled against the most recent version of OpenSSL. A re-compilation
of the WebDAV library solved the problem.
</p>

<p>
The problem I encountered afterwards was that Subversion kept rejecting my
repository's certificate. In order to solve it I had to add a pointer to the
server's .pem file to the Subversion configuration file. I mistakengly used
the wrong configuration file, but eventaully Ben Collins-Sussman corrected
me on the IRC. Then I discovered my certificate got expired, so I created
a new one that will be good for the next 30 years, and re-tried.
</p>

<p>
This whole business took a few good hours, but now everything is working
and I'm happy.
</p>

<p><b>The IGLU Server</b></p>

<p>
What kept me busy yesterday was an entirely different problem. It turned out
that the <a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/">Israeli Group of Linux Users</a>'s
web-server version of <a href="http://www.squishdot.org/">Squishdot</a> had
a cross-server scripting problem. Upgrading it requires a lot of manual steps,
and we got sick of Zope anyhow. So I had to install a new content management
system. I first tried phpBB, but could not get it to look more or less like the
original Slashdot-like way. So I switched to PostNuke, and managed to configure
most of it yesterday and today.
</p>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I finished the last "Intro to Software Systems" exercise today (yay!). I'm
enjoying the vacation before the next test.
</p>

<p><b>Biking</b></p>

<p>
I kept thinking my bike had a flat wheel. Yesterday, I went to take them to the
bike fixer and it turned out there was still a lot of air in the wheels. So,
I tried to fill the rest of it. However, in the front wheel, the filling caused
all the air to come out. Aaarrggh!
</p>

<p><b>Failed Linux Install</b></p>

<p>
The one who contacted me about Knoppix, called again, and he gave me a life
to his apartment. I brought my Knoppix CD and the Mandrake CDs with me. It
turned out his computer was constructed out of "components he found in the
garbage". Thus, we could not get either Knoppix or the Mandrake installation
CD to load, no matter what we tried.
</p>

<p>
I invited him home to see my Linux system in action. When he left he was quite
impressed from it. I'm still disappointed that we could not get Linux to
install there.
</p>

<h2>05-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>mod_php using Qmail</b></p>

<p>
I encountered some problems on iglu.org.il with PostNuke. Apparently, I could
not send mail. After I upgraded php to the latest version, I discovered that
I could send mail from the command line, but not from mod_php. By "tail -f"-ing
the web-server's log, I found out an error: "<tt>qmail-inject: fatal: read error</tt>". I searched for it and eventually found <a href="http://msgs.securepoint.com/cgi-bin/get/qmail0202/322/2/1.html">a post that says how to resolve it</a>.
</p>

<p>
Worked like a charm.
</p>

<p><b>Biking</b></p>

<p>
I tried to fill air in my bicycle's wheel, and it worked. Hallelujah! Now,
I've already went biking twice, and it's good to be back in the habit. I hope
that's the end of the phantom problems with it.
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
This and that. I've been trying to find some Subversion bugs to resolve, and
so far have been only bugging with it the Subversion development list. I also
wrote a Perl script to submit a site to <a href="http://dmoz.org/">dmoz</a>,
seeing how my browser gets stuck doing that. The script seems to submit
everything, but the site does not arrive at dmoz (checked it with my own
category). Then I discovered there is a better way for me as an editor
to submit sites.
</p>

<h2>10-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I got 93 as the final score of Financial Management. (yay!). OTOH, I did not
do too well in the last exercise of Micro-computers. I'll have to see the
T.A. about it. I also solved some exams for the "Intro to Software Systems"
test and prepared part of the next Micro-computers exercise.
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I provided fixes for two Subversion bite-sized tasks. I also worked on the
<a href="http://terje.perlgolf.org/?40">latest Perl Golf contest - Mathematical
    Forest</a> - what a delightful waste of time.
</p>

<p><b>GnuPG</b></p>

<p>
I needed to get a password from someone, who refused to talk on the phone
for some reason. So I eventually opted to generate a PGP public key and
transfer it to him, so he can send me the password encrypted. This is the
first time, I'm seriously using PGP/GnuPG for a long time now.
</p>

<p><b>Forums, Forums, Forums</b></p>

<p>
I don't like the fact that PostNuke requires registartion and logging in to
post an article, so I was looking for an alternative forum. While I was,
I discovered Phorum, which seems to behave very much like the Joel on Software
web forum. I'll try to install it on my home server and see how it behaves.
</p>

<p>
If I like it, I'll install it on the Perl Beginners' site.
</p>

<h2>14-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Kernel 2.5.75</b></p>

<p>
Persuaded by an IRC conversation with <person>mulix</person>, I set out to
install the Linux kernel 2.5.75 on my system. The first problem I encountered
was that the some of the kernel's modules would not compile. To solve it,
I removed them from the configuration, but they were still enabled by default,
so it wasn't my fault.
</p>

<p>
Then, after I had the kernel compiled, I tried to boot it only to find a blank
screen, and some hard-disk activity. It turned out I had to enable some
configuration options that enable the console and stuff. (check
Dave Jones' <a href="http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/post-halloween-2.5.txt">
    Post Halloween Document</a> for details). Then, the keyboard did not work,
and some guy on #kernelnewbie helped me with some extra options to enable it as
well.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, I was able to boot it, and use the network and the sound card. But,
then when invoking the full boot process, I encountered a problem that the
system won't start. I traced the problem to /etc/rc.sysinit, and by adding a lot
of echo messages, fixed it for the kernel. Then my system was operational,
albeit some of the startup modules did not load and had to be loaded
explicitly by me.
</p>

<p>
So, X worked, the sound card worked, and the network worked, but I could not
get the Nvidia kernel drivers to compile with the new kernel. So I switched
back to kernel 2.4.x. I can still boot 2.5.75 if I like, but I don't see much
reason to.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion Hosting</b></p>

<p>
I discovered that I could save more space on <a href="http://stalker.iguide.co.il:8080/">stalker.iguide.co.il</a> by deleting the subversion <tt>.a</tt>
libraries, and stripping the <tt>.so</tt> ones.
</p>

<p>
I plan to link to my online subversion homepage repository there, from my
homepage soon. That way people would be able to check out the source code
of it.
</p>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I took the exam of "Intro to Software Systems" today. It went pretty well and
wasn't very hard. I also handed in the assignment for this subject. Other
than that, I only have the Micro-computers exam, and the last exercise in it
to hand.
</p>

<h2>20-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
My Fix for Subversion Issue #1311 turned out to be faulty, and I discussed
the best to really resolve it with one of the Subversion developers. Next,
I provided a <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1322.shtml">fix for Issue #1267</a>
(have to say "no" several times to reject SSL certificate), which I had to
<a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1390.shtml">update</a> after a modification in the Subversion code.
</p>

<p>
Next I talked, yesterday, with Ben Collins-Sussman on the IRC about an issue I
found in the bugtracker, and he suggested a way to resolve it. So I
<a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1407.shtml">
    implemented it and added a new feature</a>.
</p>

<p>
Nothing of what I did was applied yet, which is a bit frustrating, but I hope
a core Subversion developer will find the time to review and accept my patches.
</p>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I met with my Micro-computers partner on Thursday, and we compared the
two versions of the exercise that we solved. We shortly came to a combined
version. Then there was the issue of handing it out which was resolved
by me doing so on Saturday, when my parents and I travelled to move things
out of the apartment (see below).
</p>

<p>
Since I only study on two days in the next semester, and it should be my last
, we decided to stop keeping the apartment lease in Haifa. So we went there,
and took our things, and moved them back to Tel Aviv. We took quite a lot
of things and needed a few hours and several transactions to move everything.
</p>

<p>
At one time, I climbed up the stairs (7 floors) and when I arrived I was
all sweaty, so I was told to take off my T-shirt, and after a while replace it.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion Hosting</b></p>

<p>
I encountered another problem with Subversion that took me some time to
resolve. Subversion kept rejecting my SSL certificate and asking for
confirmation. By talking on the IRC with some people, I was finally able to
resolve this.  Apparently, the problem was that I rsynced the SSL certificates
from my localhost back to the server, and so ran it over, and invalidated what
I had in the Subversion configuration.
</p>

<p>
I resolved the problem by generating a new certificate and syncing the Svn
configuration with it, and then making sure the SSL overriding won't happen
again.
</p>

<p>
Another problem solved!
</p>

<h2>21-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Perl Mongers Meeting</b></p>

<p>
This Thursday the Israeli Perl Mongers had a meeting where Stas Bekman gave
a several hours talk about mod_perl 2.0. Many people attended the meeting
(about 20-25), and we had a lot of fun. The lecture was very instructive,
and taught a lot about what can be done with mod_perl besides writing
simple CGI scripts.
</p>

<p>
After the meeting was over, I explained to someone about Subversion as he
said he had problems with CVS and was looking for a good alternative. (I
eventually wrote an <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2003-July/002634.html">E-mail to the mailing list</a> about it). Oron Peled gave me and Kfir
Lavy a ride home as he was returning home to Haifa. We asked him about his
past experience with UNIX and what he does now, and we had a very interesting
conversation on the way home.
</p>

<p><b>Project Introductions at the TAU OSS Course</b></p>

<p>
Yesterday, I went to a lecture of the Tel-Aviv University Open Source
development course. There was a lecture there about CVS, which I interrupted
with some corrections and additions. After the lecture several people and I
introduced our projects to the students.
</p>

<p>
I gave a <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Freecell-Solver/project-intro/">10 minute introduction about Freecell Solver</a> (that was
accompanied by a demonstration of kpat solving Freecell). One of the
<a href="http://xparam.sourceforge.net/">Xparam</a> developers gave an overview
of his Xparam project. Shachar Shemesh said some words about Hamakor NPO, and
then introduced the WINE project to the students.
</p>

<p>
The students in the course are expected to choose a project to work on and to
perform about 300 hours of work each on it. The Xparam guy got three students
who were interested in the project and gave him their details. When I returned
home, and checked my E-mail, I found out from the course initiator that two
students expressed interest in Freecell Solver as well, and would probably
contact me. I did not hear from them yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion and Perl Makefile.PL - problem and solution</b></p>

<p>
I now started to maintain LM-Solve using Subversion. However, after importing
the project into Subversion, I encountered a problem that I remembered
from Linux::Kernel::Module::Builder: the Makefile.PL also did something with
all the files under the .svn/ files. (and in my case even corrupted the working
copy).
</p>

<p>
A quick Googling made me realize that the solution was to install the
development snapshot of <a href="http://makemaker.org/">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a>
and use it instead. This has worked, and the Subversion resident Perl guru
told me the same thing on the IRC.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion Neon Usage</b></p>

<p>
Subversion has a problem of asking confirmation of a certificate for
as many times as the https:// path has path components, as it keeps
trying upward components. I wrote <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1390.shtml">a fix for this issue</a>, and posted
it to the Subversion development list. Ben Collins-Sussman <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1419.shtml">criticized it</a>
saying it was a workaround and maybe we are using Neon (the WebDAV client
library) wrong.
</p>

<p>
I inspected the code of Neon and found it does indeed return a plain
NE_ERROR error if the certificate's authenticity failed. This makes it
impossible to tell if we failed due to that or due to something else
altogether. We decided to wait for the Neon project head to tell us
what he makes of it, and what we should do.
</p>

<p><b>Dmoz.org Perl Tutorials Category Blues</b></p>

<p>
My application for editing the Dmoz.org Perl "FAQs, Help and Tutorials"
category was rejected for the third time. This time, there were problems
in the grammar of my submission (which I'll make sure won't happen next time)
and some vague critique of what is present in my existing categories. I should
probably go over them and fix it, and then try to apply again.
</p>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I got 86 as the final score in Introduction to Software Systems after I got
83 in the test. My final exam for this semester is two days from now, and I
hope it will go as well as the others.
</p>

<p>
There was a project brewing on writing a Freecell solver. I contacted its
supervisor today asking if I can take it next semester, but he said he already
filled the quota of projects he can give, and so I cannot. :-(.
</p>

<h2>25-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Subversion and Neon Verdict</b></p>

<p>
At the end, the Subversion maintainer told us we can use the HTTP error code
to distinguish between the different kind of errors Neon is returning. So I
wrote an <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1500.shtml">updated patch</a> and Ben Collins-Sussman commited it. (thanks, Ben!). Now,
there's a part of me in the Subversion core.
</p>

<p><b>LM-Solve Re-work</b></p>

<p>
I spent part of the last couple of days reworking <proj>LM-Solve</proj>. I
started out <a href="http://stalker.iguide.co.il:8080/svn/lm-solve/">a
    Subversion repository for it</a>, changed its namespace to "Games::LMSolve",
added a lot of documentation, etc. It's also in CPAN now.
</p>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I took the test of Micro-computers on Wednesday. It went pretty well. I was
first worried that I won't have enough time to finish it, but then it turned
out I did have, even without the time extension. I still don't know what
my score is. This is my last test for this semester, so now I'm <b>free</b>!.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion</b></p>

<p>
I submitted a patch to add a <tt>--config-dir</tt> option to the subversion
command line clients to specify an alternate directory for the configuration
files. The first incarnation became out of date after a change in the code.
The <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1666.shtml">second
    one</a> was also more encompassing, and modified more configuration
commands. I still have a small queue of patches that did not get accepted yet.
</p>

<h2>2-Aug-2003</h2>

<!--

* August Penguin II Event

* Dmoz.org category
-->

<p><b>August Penguin II</b></p>

<p>
I attended the August Penguin II event yesterday. It was very nice and
I met many people I knew there. At first Shachar Shemesh gave an instructive
presentation about the Linux activities in Israel the past year. Then, there
was a lecture about MOSIX by one of its Hebrew University workers. It was
very nice as well. Afterwards, <person>moshez</person> gave a lecture about
PyPy, instead of the Python internals lecture that appeared in the agenda.
Moshe is a very entertaining lecturer and the lecture went very well.
</p>

<p>
Then came the geek trivia, which pitted two groups of three "geeks" and "nerds"
against each other. It was very fun. And finally, came the key signing party
, which I took part in and signed the keys of 20 people or so.
</p>

<p>
There were a few glitches there, as far as I was concerned. First of all, I
discovered the building did not have any coolers and I had to drink water from
the taps of the restroom. Then, it was too cold in the lecture hall, and I
had to leave once or twice to regain my senses. Finally, my ride back to home,
disappeared during the key-signing party, which caused me to have to take the
bus again. But all in all, they did not spoil the fun.
</p>

<p>
After the event was over, I went back home, ate, and went to sign everybody's
key. It turned out <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg28626.html">some
    of the key could not be checked out of the servers I tried</a>. (read the
thread for more information). However, it turned out <person>mulix</person>
who organized the key signing party, prepared a keyring with all the keys,
and was about to send it to everyone for signing. Thus, I was able to sign
the rest of the keys.
</p>

<p><b>Freecell Solver</b></p>

<p>
I discovered a game of Simple Simon that could be solved by hand, but not
by Freecell Solver (which gave up after checking only the initial state). So
I set out to discover why. Apparently there was a function there which was
responsible for performing the initial move, only it had a bug. I only had
to remove one = from an <tt>&lt;=</tt> operator and the bug was fixed and
the game was solvable. Hah!
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I finished a large part (most?) of "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture :
Best of the Perl Journal". I also read the Freshmeat GUI Toolkits feature
and started reading ESR's "The Art of Unix Programming" which is very
interesting so far.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion</b></p>

<p>
I wrote a couple of tests for my Issue #1297 patch, and indeed the unpatched
Subversion failed them both. However, I was told the patch is not correct
because it does not handle some working copy parameters correctly.
</p>

<p><b>LM-Solve</b></p>

<p>
After releasing version 0.8.0 I discovered a bug and released version 0.8.1.
Now I think I did not document the Hexagonal Planks ID in the man page of
the executable so I'll need to release 0.8.2... :-). In any case, I also
revamped the <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lm-solve/">LM-Solve
    homepage</a> and now maintain it separately from my homepage.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I announced LM-Solve on Freshmeat.
</p>

<p><b>Dmoz.org</b></p>

<p>
I finally got permission to edit the Perl "FAQs, Help and Tutorials" category
on dmoz.org. I created a tutorials sub-category and will move all the
tutorials there. I might create other sub-categories there if I feel the
main one becomes too crowded. Let me know if there's anything you'd like to see
there.
</p>

<p><b>Lectures</b></p>

<p>
I prepared <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Perl/Graham-Function/">a lecture about my solution to the Graham Function
    Perl Quiz of the Week</a>. This time I used PerlPoint, which enabled me
to quickly translate the summary into the lecture itself. Here's
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/3349">a discussion
    of it on Hackers-IL</a>.
</p>

<p>
I also prepared a summary (but not the slides themselves) for a lecture about
LM-Solve. Both are intended for the next Israeli Perl Mongers meeting.
</p>

<h2>7-Aug-2003</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I finished preparing <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/LM-Solve/slides/">a lecture about LM-Solve</a>.
Then I worked on Subversion, and formed <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-08/0309.shtml">an updated patch to Issue #1297</a>.
This took a really long time (almost an entire day), but I'm really
happy that it's complete now. The fix had a small bug-let which was easy
to fix by adding a few lines.
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I sort of finished reading "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture", and
reached to the middle of "The Art of Unix Programming"'s chapter about
Mini-languages. TAOUP is a very interesting and entertaining book as is
the usual tradition with <person>esr</person>'s writings.
</p>

<p><b>Perl Meetings</b></p>

<p>
Gabor Szabo, who is the Israeli Perl Mongers leader is abroad, and as
it turned out Shlomo Yona, who was appointed to organize the meeting
instead is busy moving to a new apartment. Thus, <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2003-August/002765.html">I took the lead</a>
and decided on how to resolve the date, place, etc. issues for the next
meeting.
</p>

<p><b>Translucent Cursor</b></p>

<p>
I wanted a Knoppix-like translucent cursor for my X-Windows. So,
I asked around the IRC. Someone told me a similar effect exists in
the cursor_themes package found in the Mandrake Cooker. Looking there,
I found it. The cursor is darker than the Knoppix one, but still is
nice in a way. The package has other interesting themes, which I may
try out.
</p>

<h2>10-Aug-2003</h2>

<p><b>Subversion</b></p>

<p>
It turned out my updated patch was not <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-08/0403.shtml">acting according to the Subversion conventions</a>.
What I did wrong was not create temporary files, and not use the run log
mechanism to perform the operations that could be performed with it. So,
I sat on it on Friday, and wrote an <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-08/0420.shtml">updated patch (revision 5)</a>. This <a
    href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-08/0471.shtml">was
    applied</a>, and so I'm happy.
</p>

<p>
Today I took some time to prune my patches archive from patches that were
already applied.
</p>

<p><b>Haifa Apartment</b></p>

<p>
I met with the Apartment owners and one of my apartment-mates on Friday
to settle the payments for the apartment. There was a bit of a fuss between
my dad and the owner, about a payment for replacing a lock that was done
a year earlier. But other than that it went fine.
</p>

<p>
On the way back, I ate lunch at the MacDonald in the Yoqne'am Mall.
</p>

<p><b>Other Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I worked and reviewed the lectures I wrote a bit. I've started adding missing
slides to the Gimp lecture I prepared, and hopefully, I'll put the full
lecture online soon. Other than that - not much.
</p>

<p><b>Hard-Disk Problems Revisited</b></p>

<p>
A few days ago, I got the same faulty noises when booting the hard disk. A
reboot did not help, but after I started Knoppix and mounted it, everything was
fine. Today, the same noises also happened, but this time the system could
load. Hmmm... I think I'll try to buy a new hard disk as soon as I can.
</p>

<h2>14-Aug-2003</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
This and that. I've organized my <a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/svn-patches/">Subversion patches directory</a> to
exclude patches that were already applied. That way, the other maintainers
can best know what needs to be applied. I've been looking for other Subversion
issues to work on, and found some candidates, but so far did not find the
time to work on it.
</p>

<p>
I also made progress in translating "Homesteading the Noosphere". A couple
of people contacted me with corrections to it, and I'm grateful for them.
Then, I made the data for my version of the Haifux lectures manager
up-to-date with recent lectures.
</p>

<p>
Finally I edited the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell">Wikipedia
   entry of Freecell</a> to make it less lame and more accurate than it was. I
   actually woke up in the morning thinking about Wikipedia and whether it
   mentions Freecell, checked it a bit afterwards, and in the evening changed
   it. ;-)
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I read part of the book about Statistical Physics and Thermodynamics I have
(I'm studying Thermo next semester). I also read the first two chapters
of "The House of Arden", after being reluctant to read it for a while.
</p>

<p><b>Free Software "Monopolies"</b></p>

<p>
<person>jlouis</person>, I don't really see free software "monopolies" as
a bad thing. It takes a lot of time and effort to create quality software,
and so it make sense one or a few packages will rise above the rest, and
concentrate most of the effort around them. If we take gcc, for example,
then everybody use it because it's a great and trustworthy compiler.
</p>

<p>
I don't see much point in switching to using anything else, just to make
an anti-monopolistic point. If gcc works, I am sticking with it. If something
better ever comes along, I might switch, but there isn't anything better
now. If you ask me, you'd better hack on gcc and make it an even better
compiler than it is now, then try to make a half-decent competition.
</p>

<p><b>Certification</b></p>

<p>
Certified <person>jlouis</person> as Apprentice because of the above and
other stuff I found on his homepage.
</p>
