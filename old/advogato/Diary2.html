<p><b>Aegis - Full Throttle</b>

<p>
<i>"Don't whine unless you are going to contribute"</i> - first rule of
open-source programming. That's why I'd like to suggest the following
to the good Aegis people and hopefully I will implement it myself:

<p>
<ol>
    <li>
    The Logo is too dowpy and sexless. You need a similar wheel only smaller,
    with the light behind it and with cool lights and shades games.
    <person>ladypine</person>, would you be so kind as to ask your friend
    Smackware to do it. I can spare some time hacking with the gimp or with
    Corel-Draw, but I'm sure she'll do a better job.
    </li>
    <li>
    You need a built-in permissions system. Relying on UNIX' one is a bad
    idea. It should not be too hard to isolate it in one place and then
    subclass it accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
    You need a native Win32 port, that does not require cygwin.
    </li>
    <li>
    You need to take every good BitKeeper feature there and duplicate it.
    </li>
    <li>
    You need to convert to the [MAJOR].[MINOR].[BUGFIX] scheme and release
    a version that only adds a few critical features.
    </li>
    <li>
    You need a server with a dedicated connection.
    </li>
    <li>
    You need a better homepage. I volunteer to design one with WebMetaLanguage. ( and needless to say volunteer to do everything else in time)
    </li>
    <li>
    You need integration with Emacs and MS Dev Studio, gvim and what not.
    </li>
    <li>
    You need an Aegis Kernel Cousin or an Aegis Weekly Report, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
    You need to be more Bazaar-style (a la CatB)
    </li>
</ol>

<p><b>Programming is Done in the GUI...</b>

<p>
A real conversation with two fellow students in Com-Net who are working
on a front-end to IP-Tables.

<p>
<b>Shlomi</b>: Why are you using Kylix?<br />
<b>Other</b>: Why not?<br />
<b>Shlomi</b>: It is not standard.<br />
<b>Other</b>: But it's the best there is out there.<br />
<b>Shlomi</b>: There's glade and kdevelop and Anjuta...<br />
<b>Other</b>: They don't come close to Kylix' level.<br />
<b>Shlomi</b>: You'll have a much easier time using Perl/Tk or Perl/Gtk
or Tkinter or Tcl/Tk, or PyGtk or whatever.<br />
<b>Other</b>: Yes, but instead of writing a lot of code we just drag a button
to here... Much Simpler.<br />

<p>
That reminded me of what Gil'ad Ben-Yossef said about programmers who know that
programming happens in their head and not in the IDE, and why <b>they</b>
are still needed.



<p><b>The Ultimate SCM</b>

<p>
First, right a SPEC, so here goes:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
* Support Patchsets
* Support Cancelling Patchsets
* Support Distributed Respositories
* Support Branching and Tags as well as CVS
* Support distributing patchsets across branches.
* Has nice GUIs and nice gdb/bash-like CLIs for doing anything
* Nice integration with bash/zsh/emacs/MS DevStudio/KDevelop/
  Borland's Stuff/etc.
* Fully Free Software. Preferably LGPL or lighter.
* Easy to use - can be learnt in a day.
* Work on several patchsets simultaneously
* Repository can be reset to any state at any time
* Has its own internal permissions system which would be very flexible.
* Copy and rename of entire directories or files.
* Merge two or more files together.
* Split a patchset into several patchsets.
* Openlogging. However, such with the ability to cache intermediate logs
and then compress them and send them in one bulk.
* Atomic repository-wide commits.
* clone/push/pull including ones using UI.
* a default "parent" repository so no need to remember which one to
do a push or pull to.
* Ability to work on a copy of the files, instead of a copy of a repository.
* Work flawlessly on Windows - a native Win32 port. (VMS and MVS - also a
good idea, but of lesser priority)
* Fast to work with. (no waiting for ages over an ADSL line for the
 "changeset" to get to BerliOS)
* Files spread across the filesystem, so a corrupted file will not ruin
everything. (unless of course, the format has error correction and is stable)
* Grabbing a certain portion of a file into another one, and magically
maintaining them both together. ( a bad idea programmatically but could prove
of use).
* Magic sub-branches: A diff that would be applied against a certain file upon
downloading. (change "#!/usr/bin/perl -w" to "#!/usr/bin/perl").
* Import/Export from all others
</pre>

Let me know if I missed anything.

Worked a bit on its perl.com feature. Progressing slowly but steadily.
