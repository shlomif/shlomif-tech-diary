<h2>02-Dec-2002</h2>

<p><b>Internet Bits and Pieces</b></p>

<p>
The Technion's connectivity is fine now, but has been a bit sporadic lately. (sometimes it congests). What does
not work is my CVS repository at BerliOS. It seems that
I can't even login into the CVS server, even from shell.berlios.de. And the new CVS instructions on the project's page are lacking.
</p>

<p>
I joined a <a href="http://www.webdesign-l.com/">web-designers mailing
list</a> which I spotted on Google. So far, the traffic there has not been particularily high, and the SNR is quite high (lots of talk about HTML standards, CSS, etc.). I received one response (in private) to my question about how to make the navigation looks fine in MS Internet Exploder, so I'm going to switch to Windows and tinker with the CSS stylesheet. Then I'll have to switch back to Linux and fix it in the WMLized source, and upload it again. &lt;sigh /&gt; Maybe I should use VMWare or Cross-Over Office.
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I download the source RPM of the new version of aspell, compiled and installed. Using its HTML/SGML mode I was able to spell check one of the chapters of the Architecture Document. I could not commit it into the CVS yet, due to the aformentioned BerliOS problems so I'm on hold now until it is fixed. The previous version of aspell gave me problems when ran in HTML mode, and Emacs's ispell-buffer mode started asking me to verify all the DocBook/XML tags, which made it quite useless. It's good to know Kevin Atkinson is hard at work on aspell.
</p>

<p>
I also managed to do a lot of <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/philosophy/solving/israel/lectures/origins/slides/">the
Solving lecture</a>: covered Neo-Tech, and Homesteading the Noosphere and almost finished the Magic Cauldron. What's left is giving a section that explains how Solving integrates and expands on the two, and giving it some final touches, and adding sections if necessary.
</p>

<p>
I received a user account on a Co-Op server and am going to set up a globally accessible Subversion repository there. So far Berkeley DB-4.0 compiled without a problem. However, Apache 2.0.x requires the headers of OpenSSL to compile mod_ssl and it is not available there. I guess I'll have to wait for it to be installed.
</p>

<p>
./configure and the compilation of C modules is very fast on this machine, so it must be a pretty spiffy one. I remember timing the Freecell Solver scans ran so much faster on the Pentium 4 1.7 gHz at the Com-Net Lab than it did on my P3 667 MHz workstations. Working on my home P3 600 MHz is also pretty nice and fast, but greater speed still makes you a bit less frustrated.
</p>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>
It's Hanukah now, so I light up the candles every evening, and we eat latkes. The weather has become quite cold at night. The Technion was closed yesterday and today, so I'll have to postpone doing my arrangements on Tuesday.
</p>

<p>
I have to check the "Hever" students' personnel company for available temporary positions, register as a tutor for some of the courses I have taken (those that I received a suitable grade <b>and</b> feel confident enough about teaching to others), and talk with the supervising lecturer of "Intro to Software Systems" about breezing through the course. I basically know this course already, and would just like to get the extra points for it.
</p>

<p>
I got to bike twice yesterday. What I could not do was wash my hair, because we ran out of available shampoo and then there was a lack of hot water. I'm already three days late in washing my hair.
</p>

<h2>17-Dec-2002</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I've been mostly obsessed with the program I wrote to solve the <a href="http://perl.plover.com/~alias/list.cgi?mss:41:200212:bmklodhglchflancfhlm">Perl 'Expert' Quiz of the Week #8</a>. Since it was finalized, I added two optimizations and tweaked it a bit. You can see the results <a href="http://perl.plover.com/~alias/list.cgi?1:mss:1094:200212:daobcajlmfliignoncoe">here</a> and <a href="http://perl.plover.com/~alias/list.cgi?1:mss:1102:200212:kgploekfjlhkgiflcjdk">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since I decided to learn O'Caml now, I also converted this code to O'Caml. It took a lot of time to get it to compile and then I had a bug or two to iron. Google pointed me to an entire <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200206/msg00202.html">thread about Memoizing in Caml</a>. Now I should take a look at O'Caml object-oriented features.
</p>

<p>
I also finished all 100 boards of StoneAge, so I'll have another thing that won't distract me anymore. Aside from that, I now finished all the chapters of "Programming Perl" up to and including the one about regexps. I did not read too much of the other books.
</p>

<p>
I reviewed my WebMetaLanguage lecture today, and corrected some typos in one of the newer pages. I also checked out the GIMP 1.3.x from the CVS, compiled it and installed it. The fact that an older version was installed in its installation directory gave me some problems, but I after I deleted it and ran "make install" again, everything resolved itself. Hopefully, I will work on the Gradients logic a bit and get a functionality similar to my gradient-fu patch.
</p>

<p>
Lastly and very importantly, I implmemented the "{long_test_name}" notation for Freecell Solver's test order, and refactored the tests' order parser a bit. Now I still have the hard part of implementing the generic state ordering functionality.
</p>

<h2>18-Dec-2002</h2>

<p><b>Camel Book</b></p>

<p>
I'm progressing nicely with it. I have just finished the chapter about
modules, and am on page 308. By skipping to the history part, I found out it
was Perl's birthday today by coinicidence. Happy Birthday, Perl!
</p>

<p><b>Graham's Function Program</b></p>

<p>
By profiling Perl using the Devel::DProf module, I found out that the
<tt>multiple_squaring_factors</tt> function takes out %40 of the run-time.
I tried to optimize it in several ways but they all proved to be worse
than the original. Then I tried to code it in C, so I can give a lower
bound to its CPU requirements. By using the Inline::C module I was able
to write my first Perl extension:
</p>

<pre>
SV * multiply_squaring_factors(SV * n_ref, SV * m_ref) {
    AV * ret, * n, * m;
    int n_idx = 0, m_idx = 0, n_elem, m_elem, n_len, m_len;
    SV * * n_elem_proto, * * m_elem_proto;

    n = (AV *)SvRV(n_ref);
    m = (AV *)SvRV(m_ref);

    ret = newAV();

    n_len = av_len(n)+1;
    m_len = av_len(m)+1;

    while((n_idx &lt; n_len) &amp;&amp; (m_idx &lt; m_len))
    {
        n_elem_proto = av_fetch(n, n_idx, 0);
        n_elem = SvIV(*n_elem_proto);

        m_elem_proto = av_fetch(m, m_idx, 0);
        m_elem = SvIV(*m_elem_proto);

        if (n_elem == m_elem)
        {
            n_idx++;
            m_idx++;
        }
        else if (n_elem &lt; m_elem)
        {
            av_push(ret, newSViv(n_elem));
            n_idx++;
        }
        else
        {
            av_push(ret, newSViv(m_elem));
            m_idx++;
        }
    }
    while (n_idx &lt; n_len)
    {
        n_elem_proto = av_fetch(n, n_idx, 0);
        av_push(ret, newSViv(SvIV(*n_elem_proto)));
        n_idx++;
    }
    while (m_idx &lt; m_len)
    {
        m_elem_proto = av_fetch(m, m_idx, 0);
        av_push(ret, newSViv(SvIV(*m_elem_proto)));
        m_idx++;
    }

    return newRV_noinc((SV *)ret);
}
</pre>

<p>
This required a lot of consulting from the perlguts man page and the
Inline::C-Cookbook one. After I ran the script using it, I found out its
CPU usage was reduced to %10, which means the Perl implementation slows it
down a bit. Using a C extension is cheating, but I still wanted to identify
some bottlenceks.
</p>

<p>
Aside from that I also implemented <a href="http://perl.plover.com/~alias/list.cgi?1:mss:1145:200212:mpejiicmbgakocfabgog">code
    to generate the sequence that compose the perfect squares.</a> Then I
decided to see if I can generate the linear base of n+1 based on that of n,
but I realized that the base generated was lossy, and so it will not give
good results.
</p>

<p>
I go into an awful lot of trouble for this limited task. I'm positively
obsessed with it. I can't wait for Mark Jason Dominus to publish the
official solution so my mind will be relieved of it.
</p>

<p><b>Gimp Bug</b></p>

<p>
I tried to hack on the CVS Gimp code to get gradient scriptability to work
there. I looked at the gradients code a little, and sort of understood where
it falls apart. Then, when playing with the gradient editor I discovered
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101521">a bug</a> which I
reported to the <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">GNOME Bugzilla</a>. It
turned out to be a bug in glib (!) and is now resolved.
</p>

<h2>19-Dec-2002</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I left's Graham function alone today... ;-) Instead I began with some work on
Quad-Pres (my presentation tool) which involved some minor cleanups. After
breakfast, I discovered it started to rain so I could not go out to bike
today. Instead, I spent some time working on a <a href="http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/haifux/haifux/lectures_man/">lecture management system</a>
for the Haifa Linux Club Home-Site.
</p>

<p>
As of today, the situation is, that every lecture has to be placed and
maintained in several pages. I wrote a Perl script and module that will render
everything based on a set of tables that are updated at one place. Here's what
sloccount has to say about it:
</p>

<pre>
SLOC    Directory       SLOC-by-Language (Sorted)
1008    top_dir         perl=1008
0       CVS             (none)
0       dest            (none)


Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
perl:          1008 (100.00%)




Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 1,008
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.20 (2.42)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.29 (3.50)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 0.69
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 27,244
 (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40).

</pre>

<p>
2.42 person-months of effort concentrated in a day...
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, I spent the late afternoon, vainly trying to re-design the
<a href="http://syscalltrack.sf.net/">Syscalltrack Homepage</a> the
way I want it while using only &lt;div&gt;'s and CSS 2 for layout. If I
had been able to use table tags, I would have finished it in no time. After
I visited the #html channel on EF-Net I found a site that accomplishes what
I wanted to do, but was not able to fully duplicate its functionality. I'll try again later tomorrow, or simply fall back on tables.
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I made some progress with "Programming Perl", reading part of the chapter
about Objects. By reading it, I become familiar with a lot of new tricks
and new Perl nuances.
</p>

<h2>21-Dec-2002</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
Yesterday, I started the morning with giving some final touches to the
lectures' management code, and adding an extra future lecture. Then I went on
to handle the Syscalltrack homepage, converting everything to table based
layout, and handling the various issues <person>ladypine</person> had with
it. It took me sometime to understand where things went wrong, but I was
finally able to.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I did some work on Quad-Pres. I encountered a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg24052.html">Permissions conflict</a>,
where I wanted files to be created with a certain group, so they can be
handled by both the user and the httpd-ran process. Two kind Linux-ILers
answered to me how I can do that (with two different methods), and one method
I tried worked so far. (using a <tt>chgrp</tt>-like system call). The
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg24054.html">other
    method</a> seems even nicer, and I'll have to check if it works.
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I finished the chapter about Objects in "Programming Perl". Then, I went on
and finished the one about Operator Overloading. That's it, I think.
</p>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>
There was a strong wind and some raining yesterday, so I could not go out
biking again. I stayed at home most of the time, either reading or working
on the computer. At the evening, I watched "Whose Line is it Anyways?",
"Just Shoot Me" and "Third Rock from the Sun", which are given on Friday
nights.
</p>

<h2>21-Dec-2002</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
The newer method using SGID for directories, and a 02775 mode worked
beautifully so I switched Quad-Pres to using. Afterwards, I spent most of
the day cleaning up Quad-Pres and adding some new functionality. I still
did not got to implementing the global installation of the executable, Perl
code, and the common base WML template yet, but it was still a lot of
important work.
</p>

<p>
<person>ladypine</person> applied most of my changes to syscalltrack's
home-site. I wrote <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1445409&amp;forum_id=714">a message to its mailing list</a>
with some other observations. I'll have to see what the other web-masters
think about them.
</p>

<p>
At the evening, I added the ability to generate a raw list of the future
lectures to the lectures manager. This required cleaning up the code a
little, but I intended to do it anyway.
</p>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>
The sun came out at the late morning, so I went out for a walk (taking an
advice from my mother). Michal was busy all day preparing a Linear Algebra
assignment she got from school, and I helped her out a little.
</p>

<h2>29-Dec-2002</h2>

<p><b>dmoz Cleanup</b></p>

<p>
Throughout the last couple of days, I settled out on cleaning the
"Configuration Management : Tools" dmoz category. Now I'm left with 17
pending links. Man, this takes a lot of time, but I'm almost finished with
it.
</p>

<p><b>Syscalltrack's Homepage</b></p>

<p>
I started a <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/games/freecell-solver-bin.html">branch in the Syscalltrack CVS</a> to implement some homepage cleanups.
Here is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=2773565">a report</a> I wrote on what I did.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, it was reported that MSIE displays the border of the navigation bar
in white instead of black. This turned out to be a bug in the CSS stylesheet in
which the text specified <tt>border-right : medium solid ; color : black;</tt>
instead of <tt>border-right : medium solid black</tt>. I also fixed it in my
branch.
</p>

<p><b>KDE 3.1</b></p>

<p>
While looking at the KDE archives, I found out that packages of KDE 3.1-RC5 for
Mandrake 9.0 were prepared. I decided to install it. The installation went
quite OK, and my new system is stable. Some bugs were eliminated from 3.0.x
and some were added (as usual).
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough, I found old bug reports of the same bugs in the
<a href="http://bugs.kde.org/">KDE bugs tracker</a>, but then realized
they were very old. So I reported them again.
</p>

<p><b>kdegames from the CVS</b></p>

<p>
Having KDE 3.1 installed made it possible to compile the HEAD branch of kdegames
from the CVS. Took a bit to install, and the out-of-date makefiles (which I had
to run automake with) gave me some trouble. Then the DocBook documents
absolutely refused to compile, so I removed their directory from the SUBDIRS
of the makefile. And naturally, it takes a <b>long</b> time for g++ to compile
KDE code. At the end of the day, however, I had it built and installed.
</p>

<p>
This enabled me to work on kpat and integrate the changes I wanted their. I
removed the limitation for game numbers only up to 32,000, and integrated the
new Freecell Solver their. gcc was ran with a lot of extra flags (-ansi,
-pedantic, -Wundef, etc.) and it spewed a lot of warnings and complained about
many things. Eventually, however, I was able to resolve them.
</p>

<p>
Then, while trying to solve a game, I discovered <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/449">a bug in Freecell Solver</a> which forced me to release the 2.8.3 version of it. I fixed it in both CVS branches, and in
the KDE integration, and now I'm back on track. What's left to do is to
hard-code a nice command line preset into kpat, so it will have less unsolvable
games reports.
</p>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>
It was raining on and off the last couple of days. On Friday morning,
there was a beautiful sunshine and I went to bike. Then it started raining in the afternoon. On Saturday it was also sunny, so I went to a walk in the morning
and biked in the afternoon. Today seems sunny as well so far.
</p>

<p>
My sister Noa and Dad returned from their trip to England and the States. Noa
had a surgery which was supposed to handle her over-perspiration problem.
They brought a lot of toys, food, books and other stuff.
</p>

<p>
Michal (my other sister) meanwhile has homework to do. In her "Intro to
Programming" class, she had to write an C function, that removes a specified
character from a string. It can be done in O(n) time by keeping two pointers.
Today, she worked on her Linear Algebra exercises and I also helped her
a little.
</p>

<h2>30-Dec-2002</h2>

<p><b>Dmoz</b></p>

<p>
Cleanup is complete! The "CM :: Tools" category now has 4 pending links and
they are all inside the CVS sub-category which I cannot edit. Now I can
focus on other things, and just login into dmoz occasionally to see if
new links were submitted.
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
Yesterday I worked a little on Quad-Pres (turned exceptions into classes
and wrote a TODO list). I also worked on getting a Freecell Solver command
line preset into kpat and wrote two scripts to do that in the process. Then
I discovered an incompatibility of the command line interface: it changed
a <tt>char *</tt> argument, which I passed from a global constant. I changed its
code in the KDE CVS and now it is working. In any case, I think it is
a good idea I change the relevant places to <tt>const char *</tt>.
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
Since I last updated you, I read several Camel Book chapters. I'm now in the
middle of Security. Besides that I also started reading the
<a href="http://www.namesys.com/whitepaper.html">Namesys Future Vision</a>
paper which I've been referred to by several people. I admit that I did not
fully understand it. And now I also read the latest Linux Weekly News edition,
and several documents that were referred there.
</p>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>
My bike broke when I drove it on Saturday. Apparently, the chair fell down and
blocked the handle that enables to lower and upper it. When my father came
home yesterday's evening he was finally able to fix it, and brought the chair
to its right height. Now I can ride it again.
</p>

<p>
He did notice that I was out of air. The problem is that I don't think
the current air pump I use is very good, and I have troubles using it.
</p>

<h2>31-Dec-2002</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
Freecell Solver-wise, I <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/450">busted the warnings</a>
I encountered in the KDE compilation inside the CVS development version. Then
I worked a bit on <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/451">Kpat
    Integration</a>, and made sure the solver instances are recycled.
</p>

<p>
I also worked on the Syscalltrack home-site. I sent a message to a web-design
mailing list I am a member of to find out if the various versions of Microsoft
Internet Explorer, view it with the proper top vertical alignment. I already
received several inputs that they did, so I assumed the report I got was
singular.
</p>

<p>
After that, I got a green light to merge my CVS branch into the HEAD, but was
told to watch for a change that <person>mulix</person> did to the HEAD involving
the logo. I applied his change, and then used the <tt>cvs update -j</tt> command
to integrate my changes. There were some conflicts there, which I resolved
manually. And then I re-built and uploaded the site.
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
In "Programming Perl" I finished the chapter about Security, and am now
in the middle of the chapter about idiomatic programming, which is very
interesting.
</p>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>
There were more trouble with the bicycle. As much as I tried to pump air
into them I could not, and I tried two different pumps with both wheels.
When my dad returned home, he again was able to pump air there, and said the
trick was screwing them till the end, and pumping very hard and till the end.
</p>

<p>
I did manage to walk at quarter to four. In any case, since I jogged the day
before yesterday, then yesterday my feet muscles became sore, and they might be sore today as well.
</p>

<p>
It rained tonight, and the weather forecast said there are going to be local
rains today. I don't know if it would be a good idea to go biking today.
</p>

<h2>4-Jan-2003</h2>

<p>
I left you at last year, Dec 30, or maybe it was the Israeli Jan 1. So
here's what happened so far.
</p>

<p><b>Syscalltrack Home-site</b></p>

<p>
I posted a request-for-comments for the Syscalltrack web-site on
<a href="http://www.webdesign-l.com/">webdesign-l</a> and received
some <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1479532&amp;forum_id=714">useful comments</a>. The web-design people are really professional,
and the posts there are of very good quality.
</p>

<p>
Once thing I noted there is that they are recently littered with posts about
trying to get CSS2-based layout to work. This makes me happy that I'm using
table-based layout for all my site.
</p>

<p>
In a private E-conversation with Muli and Orna, it was made clear that Orna
is our official web-master and has the final verdict on everything, and that
I am just a web-technician. I also noted Muli that I might resume my efforts
working on the Perl+Lex+Yacc configurator. But like I said to him, I could not
promise anything as I have many other things to do.
</p>

<p><b>Freecell Solver</b></p>
<p>
I also worked on a detailed and elaborated <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/freecell-solver/to-do.html">to-do-list for Freecell Solver</a>.
The original TODO list found in the main distribution and in the CVS is very
brief and may only be understood by myself. The reason I did was in accordance
with what <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s11.html">ESR says in Homesteading the Noosphere</a>: "If one does
one's braggin through the code, and then says 'Well shucks, it doesn't do x, y, and z, so it can't be that good", patches for x,y, and z will often switfly follow."
</p>

<p>
Whether it will indeed happen with Freecell Solver remains to be seen. A
problem is that I feel that Freecell Solver is a fairly complete package that
satisfies the need of most "hobbyist" and "professional" Freecell gamers. It
will remain satisfactory even if no added-features development takes place
(just like Perl, gcc, gvim, Mozilla or many other "complete" packages).
</p>

<p>
Many times when developing it and releasing a release version, I felt that
"damn, after I release x.y.0, all I'd like to do with it is purely speculative,
so I can just leave it at that." But I kept discovering more and more things
to implement. I guess a project never ends, but I still can't see anything
pertinent I'd like to add to FCS after I integrate Patsolve's state ordering.
Except maybe Patsolve's mixed bfs-dfs scan and what Bill Raymond wrote for his
solver (should he agree to convert it to the new Freecell Solver architecture).
</p>

<p><b>Quad-Pres</b></p>

<p>
Not to much in this direction. The autoconf-based installer is working and
functional, but the functionality is still limited and the user documentation
is non-existent. I think I'll now begin to write some lectures and use the
<tt>quadp</tt> command line interface exclusively (in accordance with the
using your own dog-food principle). That may give me motivation to improve
it further.
</p>

<p>
I also have some craving to write my lectures using PerlPoint, because it
is very brief. Maybe I should find a nice way to integrate it into Quad-Pres
to create an hierarchy of pages. It has an API, but what could be a problem is
that the HTML it creates is quite non-standard and does not match my
conventions, and it places all the slides in one directory with names like
"slide0003.html" regardless of their organization. But when there is a will,
there is a way. The worse-case scenario is that I'll fork the code, or update
the new version in CPAN.
</p>

<p>
I should also check other presentation tools (there are dozens of them around)
and rob good ideas out of them to integrate into Quad-Pres. But first, I'd
better release Quad-Pres 0.8.0 and then make other changes I have in mind.
</p>

<p><b>Other Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I started worked on <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Vim/Vim-Lecture-Summary.txt">a summary</a>
of a lecture about Vim. It's not just as much as the summary as is the full
lecture without the fancy HTML formatting.
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I read Programming Perl and finished the chapter about Perl Culture. This brings
me to chapter V (which is the final one) which only contains reference to
many elements of perl: special variables, functions, pragmatic modules, modules
in the standard distro, etc. The perl meeting is quite close, so maybe I'll just
browse through looking for interesting parts. After all, it is present in the
man pages, and in Perl what you don't know, can't hurt you much.
</p>

<p>
One interesting thing I discovered about the book is that it is written in Perl
POD. POD is nice, but I never expected one can write serious books with it.
(that's what DocBook is for). Apparently it is possible, but I think I'll stick to DocBook for these things because it is more flexible. I'm still going to use
POD for man-pages and such small-scope documents.
</p>

<p>
I also saw that there is a module in CPAN to convert POD to DocBook
(and the other way around). This is very cool, and should prove useful.
</p>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>
Our united-states friend Ron and Carol Sekura sent us their new years greeting
along with their usual summary of what they did in the past year. I discovered
this yearly summary is a common convention among Americans. We usually don't
do it in Israel, but I wonder what I would write in mine:
</p>

<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
At January 1, I was hard at work finishing the winter semester, and also tying
the lose end-points with Roy Glasberg's and mine IP-Noise Simulator project. We
eventually were able to finish on time, and our project got a perfect 100
score, and it was considered to represent the Com-Net lab in the Technion-wide
project excellence contest. (eventually another project was chosen and it won)
</p>
<p>
The spring semester came with many interesting computer-related subjects, that
I constructed especially. They all turned out to be very interesting. Also,
nother project of creating a web-interface for managing seminars Technion-wide.
Roy and I did not have a lot of time to work on the project during the
semester. After my tests were finished (which I did pretty well in them), we
set out to work on the project together, thus "ruining" the summer vacation
once again.
</p>

<p>
The project was finished, and we eventually were graded 94. Now started the
winter semester, with many courses. My problem was that I kept changing my
schedule, and eventually decided that I'd better take a year off because I've
been studying consecutively for too long. After spending some time without
scholastic responsibilites, I felt freshened up again to resume my studies,
and so notified that I will return next semester.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>
Hah! and their cards are filled with trips and family visits, and other
entirely recreational stuff. But this is the life of a Technion student, who
is a computer nerd and does not have a dime for himself besides what his
parents give him. Not that I think my life aren't exciting: by all means what
I do in the Internet, and with my computer is very enlightening to me. I don't
think you have to travel a lot in order to accomplish a lot.
</p>

<p>
Besides, I did not mention the numerous Haifux meetings, the Welcome-to-Linux
series, my hacks and endeavours, etc. I don't know how many people who are not
computer geeks would find them interesting.
</p>

<p><b>Biking</b></p>

<p>
There were a few good days which I took to bike in the afternoon and possible
take a walk in the morning. It rained very heavily yesterday, though. Still,
in the early afternoon it stopped and there was some sunshine, so I biked to the
end of the University road and back.
</p>

<h2>6-Jav-2003</h2>

<p><b>SCMs for Linux</b></p>

<p>
I was recently contacted by <a href="http://www.linuxmafia.com/~rick/">Rick
    Moen</a> regarding the configuration management :: tools category of
dmoz. We discussed whether we should use the word proprietary and commercial
and he also mentioned he had constructed a list of SCMs which I may link to.
Since the list was in plaintext, I volunteered to convert it to HTML. I did
and I sent it to him.
</p>

<p>
I did not hear from him since until I E-mailed him yesterday. He immediately
replied that he had received my page, and modified it a bit since. He gave me
the URL and I placed it in Dmoz. Moen used quite a lot of Hebrew phrases in his
messages, and I found out from him that he's been studying in the Hebrew
university campus and also volunteered in a kibuttz. :-) From his homepage and
a Google search I understood he was quite a Linux hot-shot. Man, I'm honoured.
</p>

<p><b>Freecell Solver</b></p>

<p>
Someone contacted me regarding Freecell Solver. He said he wrote his own solver
and asked if I want to take a look. His solver was a rather crude C program,
which stored the current position in global variables, used a stack of moves.
When it recursed into a new position it applied the current move on the state,
and when it back-tracked, it undo the move.
</p>

<p>
This could have been quite smart, but there is one problem. To be solved
effectively Freecell and most game AI programs in general, need to keep track
of the previously encountered state, to determine (preferably with a good
complexity) if a state has been visited or not. His architecture did not have
a state collection, and so did not work properly.
</p>

<p>
I gave him this advice, and referred him to some Freecell Solver documentation
where he can learn about it, which is a fairly complete Freecell solving
package. As much as I support re-inventing your own wheel for fun, it is
usually faster to improve an existing wheel. He said he'll have some reading
to do, and maybe will have the mood to contribute to Freecell Solver.
</p>

<p>
On a slightly different note, I should say that I had a chat with
<person>rms</person> about making Freecell Solver a GNU package. He dispelled
some myths I acquired regarding it, but eventually concluded that it may not
be of wide-spread usefulness enough to justify GNUing it. Hopefully, I'll be
able to talk to him some more on the event on Wednesday.
</p>

<p><b>Syscalltrack Homepage</b></p>

<p>
Wow! A lot of talk and a lot of decisions passed either between Muli, Orna and
I or on the Syscalltrack-hackers mailing list. So much, that Muli and I decided
to start a separate mailing list - syscalltrack-website.
</p>

<p>
After everything, there was finally some hacking. I changed the stylesheet a
bit to agree more with other browsers beside Mozilla. It seems that Konq 3.1.x
and MSIE 6.0 have buggy CSS 2 support. The new stylesheet is still valid CSS 2,
but is simple enough to be processed correctly there. Maybe I should install
Opera to have yet another browser to check on.
</p>

<p>
I had lesser luck with the screenshot of the console. Since it was compressed
as jpeg it now has some compression noise in it, and I had a bad time
compressing it as a 256-bit png. Reducing the jpeg quality made it look much
worse in natural size. I hope the original loss-less image exists somewhere or
that Muli can quickly produce another one. I suggested taking the text,
putting it in a &lt;pre&gt; block and using some CSS styles to make it
resemeble a console Window. I'm still not sure it's a good idea.
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I decided I did not like "Emily of New Moon" so far, and began to read Daniel
Handler's "The Basic Eight" instead. It's a very funny book, which tells about
a gang of teenagers in San-Fransisco, and one girl who decides to write a
book out of her diary. (or so I understood). Very amusing, so far.
</p>

<p>
Daniel Handler also uses the pseudonym "Lemoney Snicket" when writing the
"Series of Unfortunate Events". I read the first one which was quite OK, but
a bit depressing. I decided I won't go on, because the rest of the book are
pretty much of the same vain, (sad ending, and this Count Olaf character
terrorizing the protagonists).
</p>

<p><b>Women in Linux</b></p>

<p>
I have already replied to <person>kilmo</person>'s response to my comment on the
HOWTO in private. Maybe he misunderstood what I meant to say, or maybe takes
a completely different opinion. I still, however, take the stand that the
HOWTO's proposed strategy was deficient despite the fact that some parts of it
were good and enlightening.
</p>

<h2>10-Jan-2002</h2>

<p><b>Biking</b></p>

<p>
After a long of time of not seeing here I encountered the girl^H^H^H^Hyoung
woman jogger whom I encountered for many times. As usual she was listening using
some ear-phones to a CD or mp3 player, and as usual she crossed at red lights.
When we reached the standard friday Flower-stand on the pavement, she began
walking and did not resume running. She is a very fast runner.
</p>

<p><b>"HOWTO Encourage Women in Linux - Conclusion"</b></p>

<p>
First of all regarding my status in the Linux club: it is safe and sound, and
no-one is going to outcast me as I gathered. People just find my opinions
unusual which is true. As someone whose philosophy consists of
<a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/">Neo-Tech</a>, <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Society/Philosophy/Current_Movements/Objectivism/">Objectivism</a>,
what ESR said in the Catherdral and the Bazaar series, and many extensions of
my own and others, I hold quite unorthodox opinions. I try not to preach
them intensively (that's entirely contradictory to general conventions), but I
often expresses them.  Then, people complain: "what the hell are you talking
about? This does not <b>make sense</b> at all!" And then I can show that they
are logically deducible from more basic premises.
</p>

<p>
I don't see conformism as something which is necessarily beneficial.
Everybody around me use Windows, while I use Linux almost exclusively. This is
just an example. So, to quote what I said, and is now in <person>mulix</person>
's new signature: "My opinions may seem crazy. But they all make sense.
Insane sense, but sense nontheless".
</p>

<p>But back to the HOWTO. After a nice online correspondence with the LinuxChix
issues mailing list, the following conclusions were reached:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    The HOWTO was mainly directed at men who wanted to know how they can better
    attract and accept women to take part in their Linux User-Groups. It was
    not intended for women. As such it is OK.
    </li>
    <li>
    A first draft of a similar guide for women, on how to cope with abuse from
    their male peers, is now being written by a distinguished LinuxChix member
    by the name of Poppy (it is her first name and please don't misspell it).
    </li>
    <li>
    I still have some problems with the HOWTO, but they are relatively minor.
    Namely, I think it was not made clear enough that a similar document for
    Women on how to cope with abuse would be written, and that it is intended
    for men. Furthermore, it gives too many guidelines, and you can easily not
    see the forest for the trees. Finally, the claim that a minority of
    "abusive" members can reject members from an otherwise perfectly
    enlightened LUG was not something I liked very much. And the only real
    solution is for Women themselves to stay away, ignore, penetrate or
    otherwise cope with the abuse of such minority. After all, despite telling
    blond jokes, a Linux hacker can be a fully capable and sexually enlightened
    person. One member of Haifux externalizes a lot of obsession with sex, but
    I don't think he is chauvinistic. And he is a very old, knowledgable and
    capable hacker.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
I am sorry if I criticized the HOWTO too harshly, but it was just an opinion I
expressed here. Things I say in my diary are subject to change, as everything
as I say. (I change my opinions sometimes). I hope no-one was too offended by
it, and I hope the conclusions I reached now are even more enlightening.
</p>

<p><b>Some other anecdotes from the "encouragin women" fiasco</b></p>

<p>
What happened was that I wasn't subscribed to the mailing list, and the
moderator had to acknowledge each of my reply. Eventually she got tired of
it altogether, and asked to subscribe without actually receiving messages
(which was possible using the Mailman interface), I did just that. (from now
on I'll know to do it in the future). I'll stay being able to post because this
may come in useful
</p>

<p>
One woman kept insisting that she dislikes men trying to hit on her, because it
happens way too often, and has become annoying. She later said that she hated
her body, and wish she were not attractive at all and that many women felt the
same. This is opposed to me who like my body very much (even though I need to
lose some weight), and feel an ego-boost whenever a woman makes a pass on me, or
flirts with me. (which does not happen much)
</p>

<p>
I claimed that women should be more sexually liberated, be proud of their
attractiveness, try to be as attractive to the MOTOS (or the MOTSS, for PC-ness sake), as possible. While they cannot change the fact that men hit on every
female that moves, they can at least treat it like criticism: you receive a lot
of criticism daily, but most of it is quite useless. However, sometimes it is
enlightening and causes a shift in opinions or behaviour. If an exceptionally
attractive (not necessarily only physically) man hit on them, they should
still be proud. But this is all speculation.
</p>

<p>
(she did confessed that her beloved grandmother passed away recently and so may not be in a perfectly reasonable status psychologically)
</p>

<p>
One thing we could not agreed on was this: I said that hitting on a woman on
the first time she appears at a club meeting was not a nice thing to do.
However, I believed that after 5-10 meetings when she gets to know everybody,
it is perfectly OK for a fellow LUG member to ask her on a date. (not making a
pass on by any means. A simply suggestion). She claimed this too was
illegitimate. I responded like this:
</p>

<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
Can I not ask a fellow university student on a date? Can I not ask my
neighbour on a date? If I meet a woman at a Wedding/Bar Mitzva/etc. can
I not ask her on date? Can I not ask a woman I'm meeting at the bar on the
date? (reductio ad absordum, if you did not notice)<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
</p>

<p>
I think she was taking it too far. I hope that there will soon be a roughly
equal number of men and women on LUG meetings and they will become a good an
event to ask somebody out as any. But as she noted, there were appropriate
places and appopriate times.
</p>

<p>
Another issue was the etymology of the word "girl". I referred to
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/Xantia">Chen Shapira</a> as a girl,
and was immidiately flamed for using this word, which they claimed was
derogatory. I went on by analyzing every posssible alternative (damsel, maiden, chick, lass, lassie, and even consulted M-W for maid, quail and wench) and
found none of them to be as good. And "young woman" and "young lady" are two
words. Ironically, in Hebrew there is a perfectly good word for it - "Bahura",
which is the feminine version of "Bahur" (= a guy) with no derogatory
cronations at all.
</p>

<p>
Ironically, Chen snapped it me when I told her that I referred to her as girl.
"Do I call you Boy by any chance?" (which was what the LinuxChix girl told me).
Then I said, there wasn't really any appropriate word and we started discussing
derogatory origins of words in Hebrew and English. I finally asked her if I
can call her "Hatikha" (a word for female babe in Hebrew, which was not very
derogatory). And she said, "if you really think so - fine.". ;-)
</p>

<p>
I asked my sister Michal (who is 23 years old) if she is willing that someone
refer to her as "girl" and she said that it would be perectly OK. Maybe it's
because Chen used to be a feminist (or some other women-lib activist) and so
was still a bit edgy. Michal, OTOH, was never obsessed with women
discrimination, but is still very intelligent and competent.
</p>

<p>
One should note that the word "guy" or "guys" can sometimes be a substitute for
"girl". "Rachel, you're a nice guy". "Hey guys - listen". But the following sentence would make little sense "I met a guy at the bar, talked to her and she
gave me her phone number." Etymology is fascinating. Seriously.
</p>

<p>
There was one point where I noted I'll just listen and not contribute much
because it was spending too much of my time and I had plenty of other things to do. I noted that it was nice of my original post in the first place and to
respond to their comments. But I was not responsible to do it in any way.
(it was their privilege, not their right).
</p>

<p><b>The IBM Event and the RMS Dinner</b></p>

<p>
Hmmm. So much to tell, but I already spent too much time on this dictionary.
I'll tell it some other time. Just a quick note to <person>mulix</person>: I
deliberately introduced myself to Ted Ts'O as "Hi! My name is Shlomi Fish. I'm
a Linux user and developer who developed Freecell Solver, a program that
attempts to solve games of Freecell and occasionaly makes a good job at it"
(and that's it). The reason I preferred it over "Hi! Shlomi Fish! &lt;shaking
hands /&gt;" is because I knew Shlomi Fish would be just another random name
for him which he probably would not remember (I know I wouldn't), and with
this introduction he can at least associate me with a relatively successful
open-source project. A purely strategical choice. I'm sure you could have
introduced yourself as "Hi! I'm Muli Ben-Yehuda! I work in IBM as well here in
Haifa. You may know me as the Syscalltrack Guy" Nothing wrong with that.
</p>

<p>
Later on, I met Mr. Ts'o outside and we discussed the possible adoption
of my "IP-Noise Project" (which is specifically Linux-based), The Ken Thompson
"Reflections on Trusting Trust" effect, and GNU/Linux on PDAs, home computes
and stuff. You can ask him for what he thought of me, but he did not seem one
bit annoyed by me.
</p>

<p><b>Syscalltrack Homesite</b></p>

<p>
I decided to convert it to XHTML 1.0 Transitional so it will have a more strict
syntax. I indeed found some errors in the validation, but it went very quickly.
</p>

<p>
You can see what I did <a href="http://syscalltrack.sourceforge.net/beta/">here</a>. At least I managed to get <b>some</b> hacking done. *sigh*
</p>

<h2>12-Jan-2003</h2>

<p><b>CLAN - The Comprehensive Linux Archive Network</b></p>

<p>
I pondered an idea for this for some time. Yesterday I went to
irc.kernelnewbies.org there, found <person>riel</person> and some other
people and discussed it with it. He liked it so I wrote
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/clan/clan.html">whitepaper</a> and posted
it to the Linux Kernel Mailing List. Tzafrir Cohen gave me some useful
commentary. What it does basically is allow to download, compile and install
kernel modules incrementally while resolving dependencies. Something
like Perl's CPAN or Debian Apt meets the Linux Kernel.
</p>

<p>
Right now, I'm pondering how to implement it in a robust enough way, and maybe
should start hacking on a SPEC. riel said hosting should not be a problem,
but that I'll need to make sure I'm serious about it. If anyone wishes to do
it instead of me, (or bring out ideas, SPEC portions, etc.) feel free to.
</p>

<p>
On the IRC, riel and some other guys also discussed Perl modules and objects
and what you should use them, and also a system they wrote at Connective (where
Rik-van-riel) works that is something like dmoz meets Slashdot, and he claims
makes the support guys job much easier. He said something about the code being
in Portugese (variables, function names, comments and all) and that they wish
to clean it up before they releas it. I've seen a Freecell implementation (with
its own solver) code written in French, and it was not something I could begin
to understand. <tt>use English;</tt>!
</p>

<p><b>IBM Event and RMS Dinner</b></p>

<p>
The lectures in the IBM Event where cum-si cum-sa. The Israeli Organization
of Information Engineers guy told a nice joke, and made a useful comment
about open-source in the government. Basically, the government should not be
forced to use OSS because it can stand on its own merits technically and
philosophically. However, I do think the government should make sure its
users will not be forced to use proprietary software which they'll have to
pay for.
</p>

<p>
An IIS and Oracle site that outputs valid HTML and looks fine in Mozilla, Konq
, Opera, etc. is acceptable. MS Word documents for download (without PDFs or
HTML) are not.
</p>

<p>
Next came Moshe Bar's lecture which confused the hell out of the terms "free
software" and "open source software". Generally Moshe Bar's lecture are pretty
good, but this time I was very disappointed. I tried to correct him sometimes,
and he dismissed me and there's a discussion of it in the Linux-IL archives.
</p>

<p>
Next came Theodor Ts'o lecture. He is not head of the IBM Linux Development
Center (or something like that) and talked about everything IBM is doing with
Linux and Open-Source. I hope Mr. Ts'o won't take it the wrong way but the
lecture was too long and there were too many names and numbers and not enough
meat. I left it a couple of times. (but note my impression from Ted below)
</p>

<p>
Next was a brief but to the point lecture about PHP and Zend Inc. which was
very interesting. I did not learn anything too new but it was interesting.
</p>

<p>
Next came a lecture about the Eclipse IDE project. The project has an
interesting design and goals and is widely deployed, but since I'm not an avid
IDE user (give me konsole, gvim, gcc, make, gdb, perl, perl -d, Subversion, etc.everyday) and found Eclipse exteremely unconventional to what I was used to, I
went away. I think the lecture was interesting, though.
</p>

<p>
I met Ts'o outside, and we had a few chats. In one he explained to me that ext2
uses the standard direct, indirect, indirect-&gt;indirect, etc. convention that
is common on the UFS, which I learned at at the course Structure of OS in the
Technion. We also talked about my IP-Noise project and if he can recommend
anyone who knows where I can forward a "call for adoption" notice. He instructed
me to E-mail him which I did. Another chat (between him, me and several other people) was on Linux for the masses, Linux on PDAs, Life, the Universe and
Everything.
</p>

<p>
He calls Linux "liynex" but otherwise is one hell of a nice guy from my first
impression, and a good speaker. Ted, next time, please include concrete
examples in your lecture. All those graphs, facts, figures, etc. bored the
hell out of me.
</p>

<p>
Right afterwards was a Linux dinner which we decided to do with RMS or without
it. (he did eventually came straight from the airport). I was disappointed from
the RMS-part of the dinner, because I did not get to talk to him too much, and
was pre-empted. Other people were disappointed from me because I did not behave
very well. What was interesting was the company.
</p>

<p>
I met two Hebrew University students who work on the MOSIX team. I talked with
one of them about open-source and then mentioned the Cathedral and the Bazaar.
He said he printed it the same day, and intended to read it. I hope
"Amnon Barak" reads it as well, and MOSIX will become a true open-source
project and not just one of those projects with a free software license. Taking
Freecell Solver - I did more than 95% of the work on the code. But it would
have advanced nowhere, if it were not for the users' feedback, motivation,
encouragement, ideas, compliments and even the occasional contribution. I'm not
sure it was 100% Bazaar-style, but it was quite close. And even in most
Bazaar style projects the core group is very small - usually one or two people.
</p>

<p>
openMOSIX was supposed to be a MOSIX fork that was done bazaar-style. Now Prof.
Barak is a bit possessive about the source, and so shined away from it. I do
hope these projects merge in a certain point into one Bazaar-style project
headed by Barak (or an anarchy-style project like KDE). But at the time being
Prof. Barak won't accept patches to the code even if they are perfectly fine.
</p>

<p>
I then met Mark Veltzer and few people I did not know, and started talking. We
began discusssing the "Microsoft - Good or Evil" endless-discussion. I maintain
that Microsoft should be left alone and suffer from their own mistakes and
dogma. I also believe Microsoft is smarter than many think it is, and eventually
port stuff to Linux, and adopt a more bazaar-like development style of its
software. I don't think they will ever go entirely open-source, but I think they
can survive to one extent or the other in an open-source dominated world.
</p>

<p>
Making free software is not about getting rid of Microsoft. It's about changing
the rules of the game and making people more free to choose their software,
and better be aware of their freedom. As was noted in the conference IBM is the
god-mother of proprietary software, distributed such a long time before
Microsoft, and still does. It is now one of the largest open-source developers.
I think Microsoft can adapt as well as IBM can. It dumped DOS in favour of
Windows and MacOS, and can dump both in favour of Linux and MacOS X. This will
give them all other UNIXes for free. (just re-compile) And Windows has become
so over-engineered, over-complicated, over-x86-specific, over
backwards-compatible, over-bloated, and over-un-understood, that they have
more profitable pathes to do with the elite group that is supposed to maintain
the Windows XP code. (which is the Linux equivalent of the kernel, glibc, X, gtk+, half of GNOME, bash and a lot of the GNU fileutils etc., Mozilla (IE within),atd, CORBA, and maybe other things I forgot).
</p>

<p>
Granted, some things are nicer in Windows. Multi-threading for instance. But it
would take less time to tweak gdb to better support threads, than it would be
to fix all the Windows brain-damage around. I once preferred using Win98 over
Linux for doing non-development stuff. Now I simply can't stand Windows, not
even Windows XP. My Mandrake system with KDE 3.x and everything on it gives me
so much more opportunities and is so much more comfortable. I can easily show
that there are things that are trivial in Linux which are not possible in the
Windows XP as it ships from Redmond. Many things.
</p>

<p>
If Microsoft wants to beat Linux they would have to seriously hack on the
already bloated code. But sometimes, if you can't beat them - join them, and I
think that's what they'll eventually do.
</p>

<h2>24-Feb-2003</h2>

<p><b>"Open Source, Free Software and Other Beasts"</b></p>

<p>
I wrote <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/oss-fs/">an essay aims to introduce
open source, and free software to beginners</a>. It covers the history, the
meaning of the terms and some issues and myths. It's a bit longish (14 A4
pages), but otherwise aims to be encompassing enough.
</p>

<p>
Chen Shapira has reviewed the early versions of the document, and gave some
very essential commentary (including how to trim them - they were even
longer than now). <person>nyh</person> summarized the history of early UNIX
and the BSDs for me, so I'm grateful for him as well as I was able to use
it and link to it.
</p>

<p>
Hope you enjoy it and let me know what you think. At the moment, I've started
working on another document titled "Free the Mouse!". It is a critique of
current copyright law, a proposal for modification, and an explanation why
it would benefit both consumers and content owners (large and small).
</p>

<p><b>IRC Chatting</b></p>

<p>
I spend quite a lot of time recently chatting on the IRC. I use the
irc.kernelnewbies.org network, and usually hang on on the #offtopic channel.
It's a cozy little channel with a good SNR, and some very enlightened and
interesting people. It's a way to procrastinate I suppose, but then again,
I don't have anything critical to do until I start studying.
</p>

<p>
<person>wli</person> and I have actually fought about our keyboard preferences
(Sun vs. PC). wli seems to be very knowledgable and interesting. It turned out
that as opposed to me he started working on computers from UNIX workstations,
and later switched to Linux on PCs. I, OTOH, actually worked with DOS, Windows
3.1, and various Win32 variants. I think that you appreciate UNIX much more
after you work on some really sucky OSes like that. I kept knowing they were
bad, but not knowing why, until I started working on UNIX, where I saw a
sensible system for the first time in my life. :-)
</p>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>
It's still raining on and off. Yesterday, I was able to bike twice, but today's
its raining. I'm going to start studying a week from now on Monday. I eventually
decided to take a semester off instead of a year off. At one point I believed
I had enough recreation, but now it seems that I'll miss having all this
free time. Oh well, the Summer vacation is not far away, and there are some
holidays and weekends as well.
</p>

<p>
I do wish to be able to hike sometime in the springtime. It's been a long time
since I've been outdoors.
</p>

<h2>27-Feb-2003</h2>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>
Still raining on and off, so not much biking for me. I'm spending a lot of
time on the IRC lately, but still can get some useful work. Besides, when
I start studying again this Monday, IRC would not be as accessible and much
less recommended. So I'd better make the best use of it now. And even wasting
time is good if you're enjoying it. ;-)
</p>

<p>
My father and I went to buy a new desk lamp for my Haifa apartment, right
before he went to England. The light bulb holder there is broken, and so
the room would be completely dark without it. Mom and I are going to set
things up in the Haifa Apartment this weekend. At the time being, I don't
spend too much time thinking about studying, but I suppose it will occupy
quite a lot of my time, soon. Hopefully, this semester, should not be too
hard.
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
Worked a bit on <a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/shlomif/perl-begin/">my
    version of the Perl beginners portal</a>, a bit on revamping the perl 5
perl*.pod man pages, and some on
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/oss-fs/docbook/">DocBookifying
    the OSS/FS document</a>. I ran into a few problems with the PDF generation
of DocBook (namely that Hyperlinks and footnotes are not functional), and I
hope the good people of the DocBook-apps mailing list would help me soon.
</p>

<p><b>Some IRC, E-mail, etc. Musings</b></p>

<p>
<person>riel</person> is <a href="http://surriel.com/nh.shtml">moving out to
    New Hampshire</a>, while being in Brazil at the moment. The link is quite
informative, so I suggest you read it if you are wondering about this issue. He also confirmed the fact that the core Connectiva distribution was open-source,
much like RedHat, Mandrake or Debian. According to LWN, some non-free
distributions proved to be a bit risky after they become defunct. Suse and
Caldera are doing fine, but I still would not trust them.
</p>

<p>
I noticed a certain pattern with the #perl channels on the IRC. In EF-Net,
#perl is reserved for expert talk and no CGI/Web/Net::IRC/newbie questions
are allowed. That is reserved for #perlhelp. Of course, a lot of newbies
log on to the IRC seeking perl help, and go to #perl, and without reading
the subject-line (Rule #2 of GUI design: people don't read!), ask one of
those common questions there. And I instinctively try to help them, only
that both of us get flamed later on.
</p>

<p>
I think it would have been a better idea to create a #perlguru channel
and designate #perl as a channel for everything including newbie questions. In
Undernet, there's this permanent profile with a few scripts, that bans anybody
who mentions the word CGI... I was eventually banned after using "c g i" and
"c**" and posting a perfectly innocent URL. Again, something that could be
remedied by designating #perl as a channel that accepts Newbie questions.
</p>

<p>
This all reminds me of Linux-IL and how newbie questions used to cause a lot
of flamatory reactions. I think the situation is much better now there in this
regard.
</p>

<p>
I visited #iglu at EF-net as well, which is the channel of the Israeli Group
of Linux Users. I had a pleasant chat there. Someone asked me about Perl's
XML writing capabilites, and I asked him what was wrong with <tt>print</tt>.
Eventually it turned out he was used to a Visual Basic API that made sure
the written file was a valid XML at each point. I.e: by appending all the
closed tags to the end of the file. This requires an extra overhead, and I'm
not sure is a good idea. (in a worst case scenario, it can increase writing
from O(n) to O(n^2) for a UNIX file-system) Even so, implementing such an
object should not be too hard.
</p>

<p> I managed to help someone, I met on the IRC with a Perl CGI script he
needed to write, and ended up writing the entire script and a form to power it
for him. Which wasn't hard because all he needed to do was append a line to a
file. It eventually turned out he was an Israeli, and we ended up chatting some
more.  </p>

<p>
Finally, a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg26163.html">flame-war broke out in Linux-IL</a>
regarding whether we as Linux developers should be considerate of the needs
of Windows users as well. (e.g: use PDF instead of PostScript, maintain a port
of the software to Windows). I'll let you be the judge.
</p>

<h2>5-Apr-2003</h2>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
Technion studies have began. I'm taking four courses this semester. Three
of them were taken out of understanding that they would probably be easy to me
and the other one (Micro-computers) interested me, and was also taken by a
fellow Haifuxer. So far, I have quite a lot of homework assignments, but I
still have a lot of free time. (maybe too much for my own good). I no longer
have the Com-Net workstation due to the fact I no longer study there, and
could not get a work there. This leaves me with the Technion facilities, which
are inadequate for my needs at best. :-(
</p>

<p><b>Perl Golf</b></p>

<p>
I've been playing quite a lot of <a href="http://terje.perlgolf.org/">Perl
    Mini Golf</a> lately. Perl Golf is a contest in which the participants
try to write the shortest (character-wise) Perl program to achieve a certain
end. This creates highly compressed and obfuscated programs, with some very
unorthodox tricks, and lack of attention to conventions.
</p>

<p>
Perl Golfing is an addiction in which I routinely use gvim to edit two lines,
trying to make the second one shorter than the original. I also tend to
scan the core perl man pages a lot looking for clues on how to make it shorter.
So far, I've been doing relatively well, but there always seem to be some
people who can find better (or slightly better) solutions, and it's a bit
frustrating. Oh well.
</p>

<p><b>IRCing</b></p>

<p>
I spent most of yesterday hanging on the IRC. (despite the fact that I have
a Micro-Computers exercise that I'd like to prepare by myself this weekend).
I was able to help an Apache newbie (who actually uses Slackware and knows
his way around Linux), with the Alias and ScriptAlias directives. I also
discussed E-mail MTAs with a couple of people on the Perl channel. Then
there was naturally, #offtopic on irc.kernelnewbies.org, in which topics
ranged from the latest <a href="http://www.tpc.org/">TPC-C</a> results
for 32-way Itanium 2 machines running Windows 2003, to SMP machines in general,
to the history of ancient Europe, to Linguistics. In short: Life, the Universe
and Everything. Off-topic indeed.
</p>

<p><b>Certification</b></p>

<p>
I certified <person>wli</person> as Journeyer, because of his work on the
Linux kernel, and his vast knowledge. (I also taken into account the fact
he writes his scripts in Haskell). He is already certified as a Master,
but I'll have to know him better than my superficial familiarity with
him to do so.
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
Not much to show for, unfortunately, but quite a lot of small, relatively
useless stuff. Been working on my Haifux Lectures Manager a bit. And then
I wrote google.pl, a CGI (or mod_perl and friends) Perl script that acts
as a mirror for Google. (I did not release it yet). I also made a coverage
of the bugzilla bugs I reported, and found out most of them could be
overcome or have been resolved. Kudos to the Mozilla team for the great
work.
</p>

<p>
Per request of my Debian package maintainer, I updated the Freecell Solver
config.guess and config.sub files to the latest avaialable from the
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/config/">GNU site</a>. It took me quite
some time to find out how to get them properly, and someone on the
Autoconf mailing list helped with that. It is strange that libtool 1.4.3
which is quite recent does not contain them, but rather very old ones. Who
can tell the ways of the GNU?
</p>

<p><b>Some Thoughts about UNIX TCO</b></p>

<p>
A recent Slashdot feature pointed to an Enlightening article about the TCO
of a system with one central server and several X terminals. I've seen this
X terminals, which can only be used to connect to a server over the network,
and realize they require almost zero maintenance in comparison to
full-fledged workstations. As far as a university is concerned, by using a
server, one can install things in only one computer and allow everyone else
to enjoy it, while a corresponding client-server architecture, would require
installing packages on several different workstations somehow.
</p>

<p>
Now in a workplace where everybody administers his own workstation, the second
option may actually make sense. But a university has farms with unpriviliged
access. In the Technion we have many farms with such client-server
configurations, and the software installed on it, is inadequate for the needs
of many (if not all) students. And naturally, it is impossible to install
new one, because it requires a system-wide installation. Strangely enough,
there are also UNIX farms with a multiple workstation configuration, that
suffer from similar symptoms as well. This X-terminals configuration sounds
like a solution with a TCO from paradise, and it's interesting that the
Technion did not deploy it widely.
</p>

<h2>17-Apr-2003</h2>

<p><b>The Go-Linux Conference</b></p>

<p>
A conference for promoting Linux in Israel took place in the Hilton Hotel some
days ago. There had been a lot of buzz about it beforehand, and a lot of
prepartions. I believed I was going to study throughout the entire today, so
I did not took a very active part. I eventually attended the event from about
midday, after attending a class in the morning. I must say it went extremely
well and everybody seemed to think so as well. Hackers and Suits integrated
nicely to give an exciting yet accurate depiction of the Linux world and
potential. The conference was financed by People and Computers and many
industrial companies.
</p>

<p>
I came mostly to talk to people I know, but also attended a presentation, the
free software developers panel and the Perl-IL meeting. I bought a Perl in
Israel T-shirt for 50 NIS, but forgot it there when I exchanged some books.
(the Israeli Perl Master have taken it, so I'll get it eventually).
</p>

<p>
Refer to the <a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Linux/maillists/03/04/threads.html">Linux-IL mailing list archive for April</a> and

</p>

<p><b>Perl Beginners Site</b></p>

<p>
My Perl beginners site moved to a more
<a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/">Permanent Location</a>. As for the
standard rant+suggestions regarding the suitability of the Perl online world
for newcomers: I was not happy from most of the comments I received in the
Advogato post. Most of them beat around the bust in one way or another.
</p>

<p>
I am going to do my best to improve the situation and hope others would take
notice of it as well. At the moment, too many resources of the Perl world are
claimed by too few entities. I'd like the situation to improve.
</p>

<h2>24-Apr-2003</h2>

<p><b>Perl Beginners</b></p>

<p>
I eventually posted a link to the essay to the
<a href="http://archive.develooper.com/advocacy@perl.org/">
    perl advocacy mailing list</a>.
There I finally received a <a href="http://archive.develooper.com/advocacy@perl.org/msg01903.html">useful discussion</a> of it. I'm not sure if I was
able to convince anyone who was not previously convinced, but the discussion
was to the point and of high quality.
</p>

<p>
I also added quite a lot of new things to the
<a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/">Perl Beginners site</a>. I posted
a link to it on a web-design mailng list I am a member of, and received
a useful comment with a lot of suggestions for modifying the style and content.
I applied most of them, and planning to apply another one in a different
variation. (dedicating parts of the site for the various common uses of Perl
like CGI, QA, Bio-info, Sys Admin).
</p>

<p><b>Homework</b></p>

<p>
My Software Systems partner drove to my Tel-Aviv home to sit on the home
exercise. We had to write a rudimentary spell checker in VAX-11 assembler.
It took us all day, but OTOH we ended up talking a lot about various things,
and also took a long lunch break, to grab a byte in the commercial center, and
to recreate. At the end of the day, it worked and we were very happy.
</p>

<p>
The simulator we work with is written in Turbo-Pascal with the old Borland
style look, only a much worse behaviour and some exotic bugs and
misbehaviours. I was told that a pair of students was assigned to rewrite it
for Win32 using MFC, but they are not finished yet. What I could really use
is a UNIX-style gdb-like application, with a basic scriptability and an ability
to automate everything. As it is, over-GUIing it really decreases from its
functionality.
</p>

<p>
Since the vacation involved a lot of Jewish holidays, my partner for Intro
to Software Systems (a different course with a similar name, mind you) and I
decided that we solve the exercise independently and then compare them. So
in the recent days, I say on implementing the implementation of a linked list,
as well as a stupid dating service management that uses it. The various
operations, all have sub-optimal complexity if you ask me, but we were not
requested to do otherwise. "Oh ANSI C, ANSI C! If only you were Perl..."
</p>

<p>
Now I still have the written part of it, which should not be too hard, and then
the exercise in Financial Management. Financial Management is a relatively
technical and dry course, but one that explains many important financial
concepts such as interest rate, inflataion, loans, etc. and how they work
behind the scenes. So far, I can wholeheartedly recommend it.
</p>

<p><b>Impressions from the Mozilla Culture</b></p>

<p>
It turns out Mozilla has spawned a great deal of culture and add-ons. I
installed the Mozilla Google Bar, which is the Mozilla equivalent of the
same offering from Google Inc. to MSIE. It's really nice and handy. I also
downloaded a web-developers toolbar from somewhere, which is also very good.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I took a look at Cascades, a CSS editor for Mozilla. As it turned out,
the page was an old leftover and its functionality was already integrated into
the core Mozilla. The CSS editor is handy and gives a nice dynamic
functionality. My only problems with it is are that it: (1) bloats the CSS
stylesheet, (2) does not preserve its indendation, (3) has no decent HSV colour
picker. Still, I could rip the styles I edited and apply them manually to my
stylesheet, so it's better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
I am very glad that Mozilla spawned such rich culture, and I think what I
discovered is just the tip of the iceberg. Is there a similar case with
Konqueror/KHTML? Is it possible to program plug-ins and extensions for it
in Python or in Perl or will C++ have to do? With Mozilla, many of the things
were programmed in XUL and JavaScript, which is a much better idea as far as
the programmer is concerned than messing with C++.
</p>

<h2>08-May-2003</h2>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I sat on the "Financial Management" exercise this weekend, and met with
my partner on Monday and was able to finalize it then. I also worked on the
Micro-computers exercise. I solved Questions 1,3,4 but I don't know how to
solve question 2. Maybe my partner will have a better luck.
</p>

<p>
This Tuesday my partner for Software Systems and I sat on the project and
the third home exercise. We finished an implementation for one part of the
project, and also part of the home exercise. We should meet tomorrow as well.
</p>

<p>
There is now a vacation that started on Tuesday and will end at the Weekend,
due to the Israeli Independence Day and so on.
</p>

<p><b>Hebrew Glossary for Perl</b></p>

<p>
I started writing a <a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/Heb-Glossary/">Hebrew
    Glossary for Perl</a>. I wrote it in XML format and it took me some time
to learn the Perl XML::LibXML module to get it to render it into HTML. Then,
I also wrote a DTD for it, and prepared an XSLT stylesheet.
</p>

<p>
When I tried to view the XML in Mozilla, I got a blank page. I spent the better
part of yesterday trying to get it to work. The problem turned out to be
in the "Content-Type" HTTP header that the browser sent for the .xsl file,
which wasn't "text/xml" as it should have been. After I fixed it using a short
.htaccess file, it worked perfectly. &lt;sigh /&gt;
</p>

<p>
So I filed a <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=204748">bug report for it</a>
in the Mozilla Bugzilla but it was closed, because that's what should happen.
&lt;sigh /&gt; again.
</p>

<h2>06-Jun-2003</h2>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I handed out the "Intro to Soft. Systems" exercise, a Micro-computers exercise
about MMX, and a Financial Management exercise. Now I am working on another
Financial Management exercise, and will meet with my "Intro to Soft. Systems"
partner on Monday to work on the next exercise in that subject.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday, I'll meet Ran to work on the "Software Systems" exercise and
project. Last time, we ran into problems and after I talked with the T.A. it
turned out that we did not enable the interrupts functionality in the
simulator. After it was enabled everything worked fine. &lt;sigh /&gt;
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I was able to get several things done. First I created <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=bundle%20quadpres">
    a QuadPres Bundle on CPAN</a> to install the modules it requires. It turns
out the dependencies of the bundle, are specified in the CONTENTS POD section
in the module, and it took me some time to figure it out.
</p>

<p>
I also worked on "use strict"ing the main script of
<a href="http://chiqchaq.sourceforge.net/">the Chiq-Chaq Wiki
    Implementation</a>. I finished doing this and now I'm going
to fix the HTML to make it validate.
</p>

<p><b>Perl</b></p>

<p>
I discovered that the <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> directive does not do the
same thing as <tt>&lt;STDIN&gt;</tt>. While the second reads from standard
input, the first one tries to open files on the command line one by one.
</p>

<p>
There's also <a href="http://terje.perlgolf.org/wsp/pgas/score.pl?func=score&amp;hole=38&amp;season=1">a new Perl Golf - Boggle</a>. I'm doing pretty well at it -
I'm in 5th place. But there's still room for improvement and I'm stumped.
</p>

<p><b>Life</b></p>

<p>
My sister Noa has gone abroad the night before yesterday. She will be there
for three monthes on a trip to South America.
</p>

<h2>21-Jun-2003</h2>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
In the "Software Systems" front, my partner and I showed our presentation
to the lecturer, and he had some issues with it. To resolve it we sat on
it on Thursday, and revamped it greatly. We sent him the modified version,
but did not hear from him since.
</p>

<p>
Right now I have homework pending in Financial Management, and in
Micro-computers. The latter I only have 20% of the score left to do as I
alredy did the wet part.
</p>

<p>
I attended the various lectures and tutorials given this week. In the Software
Systems lecture, a student gave a presentation on a device he wrote using
Blue-tooth and a TI DSP, and the lecturer told us about what the company
he founded deals with. (connecting variable data sources together to integrate
information)
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I gave some touches to the list of mailing lists manager. I had to fix the
build, and integrated building an RPM Spec. I also worked on Quad-Pres a
little. Since I needed to render the presentations into HTML that is
viewable on the hard-disk, I created a script that does just that. All
it does is append <tt>index.html</tt> to links to directories. At home
, I extracted it into a module, and placed it on CPAN.
</p>

<p>
I called it HTML::Hard::Disk. However, I received a reply to the namespace
request that was sent to the CPAN module maintainers list, in which someone
claimed it was not a good name. He suggested HTML::LocalizeLinks, and
I think I'll go with HTML::Links::Localize.
</p>

<p>
In any case, I integrated its functionality into Quad-Pres, and will
probably release a new development version, and announce it on Freshmeat.
</p>

<h2>30-Jun-2003</h2>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I had the test of Financial Management yesterday. I did not understand the
first part at first so I decided to move to the second part, which was easier.
Then I returned to the first part and this time understood it and was able
to solve most of it. Now I have some vacation until the next test on July 14.
</p>

<p>
The registration for the Winter semester is today, and I hope I can make
a convenient schedule with Thermodynamics and another subject. I'd like not
to have an apartment near the Technion next semester, so I need good times.
</p>

<p><b>Knoppix</b></p>

<p>
Someone testified on GNUbies-IL that he could not run a Knoppix CD he
burned. To see if it happens for me, I downloaded and burned the Knoppix
CD. I ran it on my computer, and it ran perfectly fine. I was impressed
from it a great deal. I was able to use KDE, surf the Internet, see Java
applets, and listen to mp3s. Very impressive.
</p>

<p>
Now it seems either his CD was not burned correctly, or there's something
wrong with his computer. I'll check that out in the coming days.
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I fixed the style on my Dmoz categories. When I had tried to apply to a new
category, I was notified that the style on some of the entries did not
correspond to the dmoz guidelines. So I tried to remedy it.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, I worked a bit on Quad-Pres, and added multiple themes
functionality to it.
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I finished the chapter about SVG animations in "SVG Programming" and am now
in the beginning of "Integrating SVG with HTML".
</p>

<h2>02-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Subversion</b></p>

<p>
The day before yesterday I wrestled with two Subversion problems. The first
one was that whenever I tried to check a file out of an https:// mounted
directory, I got a strange OpenSSL-error report. An old version of Subversion
worked perfectly fine. It turned out to be a problem that the WebDAV library
was not compiled against the most recent version of OpenSSL. A re-compilation
of the WebDAV library solved the problem.
</p>

<p>
The problem I encountered afterwards was that Subversion kept rejecting my
repository's certificate. In order to solve it I had to add a pointer to the
server's .pem file to the Subversion configuration file. I mistakengly used
the wrong configuration file, but eventaully Ben Collins-Sussman corrected
me on the IRC. Then I discovered my certificate got expired, so I created
a new one that will be good for the next 30 years, and re-tried.
</p>

<p>
This whole business took a few good hours, but now everything is working
and I'm happy.
</p>

<p><b>The IGLU Server</b></p>

<p>
What kept me busy yesterday was an entirely different problem. It turned out
that the <a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/">Israeli Group of Linux Users</a>'s
web-server version of <a href="http://www.squishdot.org/">Squishdot</a> had
a cross-server scripting problem. Upgrading it requires a lot of manual steps,
and we got sick of Zope anyhow. So I had to install a new content management
system. I first tried phpBB, but could not get it to look more or less like the
original Slashdot-like way. So I switched to PostNuke, and managed to configure
most of it yesterday and today.
</p>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I finished the last "Intro to Software Systems" exercise today (yay!). I'm
enjoying the vacation before the next test.
</p>

<p><b>Biking</b></p>

<p>
I kept thinking my bike had a flat wheel. Yesterday, I went to take them to the
bike fixer and it turned out there was still a lot of air in the wheels. So,
I tried to fill the rest of it. However, in the front wheel, the filling caused
all the air to come out. Aaarrggh!
</p>

<p><b>Failed Linux Install</b></p>

<p>
The one who contacted me about Knoppix, called again, and he gave me a life
to his apartment. I brought my Knoppix CD and the Mandrake CDs with me. It
turned out his computer was constructed out of "components he found in the
garbage". Thus, we could not get either Knoppix or the Mandrake installation
CD to load, no matter what we tried.
</p>

<p>
I invited him home to see my Linux system in action. When he left he was quite
impressed from it. I'm still disappointed that we could not get Linux to
install there.
</p>

<h2>05-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>mod_php using Qmail</b></p>

<p>
I encountered some problems on iglu.org.il with PostNuke. Apparently, I could
not send mail. After I upgraded php to the latest version, I discovered that
I could send mail from the command line, but not from mod_php. By "tail -f"-ing
the web-server's log, I found out an error: "<tt>qmail-inject: fatal: read error</tt>". I searched for it and eventually found <a href="http://msgs.securepoint.com/cgi-bin/get/qmail0202/322/2/1.html">a post that says how to resolve it</a>.
</p>

<p>
Worked like a charm.
</p>

<p><b>Biking</b></p>

<p>
I tried to fill air in my bicycle's wheel, and it worked. Hallelujah! Now,
I've already went biking twice, and it's good to be back in the habit. I hope
that's the end of the phantom problems with it.
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
This and that. I've been trying to find some Subversion bugs to resolve, and
so far have been only bugging with it the Subversion development list. I also
wrote a Perl script to submit a site to <a href="http://dmoz.org/">dmoz</a>,
seeing how my browser gets stuck doing that. The script seems to submit
everything, but the site does not arrive at dmoz (checked it with my own
category). Then I discovered there is a better way for me as an editor

<h2>10-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I got 93 as the final score of Financial Management. (yay!). OTOH, I did not
do too well in the last exercise of Micro-computers. I'll have to see the
T.A. about it. I also solved some exams for the "Intro to Software Systems"
test and prepared part of the next Micro-computers exercise.
</p>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I provided fixes for two Subversion bite-sized tasks. I also worked on the
<a href="http://terje.perlgolf.org/?40">latest Perl Golf contest - Mathematical
    Forest</a> - what a delightful waste of time.
</p>

<p><b>GnuPG</b></p>

<p>
I needed to get a password from someone, who refused to talk on the phone
for some reason. So I eventually opted to generate a PGP public key and
transfer it to him, so he can send me the password encrypted. This is the
first time, I'm seriously using PGP/GnuPG for a long time now.
</p>

<p><b>Forums, Forums, Forums</b></p>

<p>
I don't like the fact that PostNuke requires registartion and logging in to
post an article, so I was looking for an alternative forum. While I was,
I discovered Phorum, which seems to behave very much like the Joel on Software
web forum. I'll try to install it on my home server and see how it behaves.
</p>

<p>
If I like it, I'll install it on the Perl Beginners' site.
</p>

<h2>14-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Kernel 2.5.75</b></p>

<p>
Persuaded by an IRC conversation with <person>mulix</person>, I set out to
install the Linux kernel 2.5.75 on my system. The first problem I encountered
was that the some of the kernel's modules would not compile. To solve it,
I removed them from the configuration, but they were still enabled by default,
so it wasn't my fault.
</p>

<p>
Then, after I had the kernel compiled, I tried to boot it only to find a blank
screen, and some hard-disk activity. It turned out I had to enable some
configuration options that enable the console and stuff. (check
Dave Jones' <a href="http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/post-halloween-2.5.txt">
    Post Halloween Document</a> for details). Then, the keyboard did not work,
and some guy on #kernelnewbie helped me with some extra options to enable it as
well.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, I was able to boot it, and use the network and the sound card. But,
then when invoking the full boot process, I encountered a problem that the
system won't start. I traced the problem to /etc/rc.sysinit, and by adding a lot
of echo messages, fixed it for the kernel. Then my system was operational,
albeit some of the startup modules did not load and had to be loaded
explicitly by me.
</p>

<p>
So, X worked, the sound card worked, and the network worked, but I could not
get the Nvidia kernel drivers to compile with the new kernel. So I switched
back to kernel 2.4.x. I can still boot 2.5.75 if I like, but I don't see much
reason to.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion Hosting</b></p>

<p>
I discovered that I could save more space on <a href="http://stalker.iguide.co.il:8080/">stalker.iguide.co.il</a> by deleting the subversion <tt>.a</tt>
libraries, and stripping the <tt>.so</tt> ones.
</p>

<p>
I plan to link to my online subversion homepage repository there, from my
homepage soon. That way people would be able to check out the source code
of it.
</p>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I took the exam of "Intro to Software Systems" today. It went pretty well and
wasn't very hard. I also handed in the assignment for this subject. Other
than that, I only have the Micro-computers exam, and the last exercise in it
to hand.
</p>

<h2>20-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
My Fix for Subversion Issue #1311 turned out to be faulty, and I discussed
the best to really resolve it with one of the Subversion developers. Next,
I provided a <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1322.shtml">fix for Issue #1267</a>
(have to say "no" several times to reject SSL certificate), which I had to
<a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1390.shtml">update</a> after a modification in the Subversion code.
</p>

<p>
Next I talked, yesterday, with Ben Collins-Sussman on the IRC about an issue I
found in the bugtracker, and he suggested a way to resolve it. So I
<a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1407.shtml">
    implemented it and added a new feature</a>.
</p>

<p>
Nothing of what I did was applied yet, which is a bit frustrating, but I hope
a core Subversion developer will find the time to review and accept my patches.
</p>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I met with my Micro-computers partner on Thursday, and we compared the
two versions of the exercise that we solved. We shortly came to a combined
version. Then there was the issue of handing it out which was resolved
by me doing so on Saturday, when my parents and I travelled to move things
out of the apartment (see below).
</p>

<p>
Since I only study on two days in the next semester, and it should be my last
, we decided to stop keeping the apartment lease in Haifa. So we went there,
and took our things, and moved them back to Tel Aviv. We took quite a lot
of things and needed a few hours and several transactions to move everything.
</p>

<p>
At one time, I climbed up the stairs (7 floors) and when I arrived I was
all sweaty, so I was told to take off my T-shirt, and after a while replace it.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion Hosting</b></p>

<p>
I encountered another problem with Subversion that took me some time to
resolve. Subversion kept rejecting my SSL certificate and asking for
confirmation. By talking on the IRC with some people, I was finally able to
resolve this.  Apparently, the problem was that I rsynced the SSL certificates
from my localhost back to the server, and so ran it over, and invalidated what
I had in the Subversion configuration.
</p>

<p>
I resolved the problem by generating a new certificate and syncing the Svn
configuration with it, and then making sure the SSL overriding won't happen
again.
</p>

<p>
Another problem solved!
</p>

<h2>21-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Perl Mongers Meeting</b></p>

<p>
This Thursday the Israeli Perl Mongers had a meeting where Stas Bekman gave
a several hours talk about mod_perl 2.0. Many people attended the meeting
(about 20-25), and we had a lot of fun. The lecture was very instructive,
and taught a lot about what can be done with mod_perl besides writing
simple CGI scripts.
</p>

<p>
After the meeting was over, I explained to someone about Subversion as he
said he had problems with CVS and was looking for a good alternative. (I
eventually wrote an <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2003-July/002634.html">E-mail to the mailing list</a> about it). Oron Peled gave me and Kfir
Lavy a ride home as he was returning home to Haifa. We asked him about his
past experience with UNIX and what he does now, and we had a very interesting
conversation on the way home.
</p>

<p><b>Project Introductions at the TAU OSS Course</b></p>

<p>
Yesterday, I went to a lecture of the Tel-Aviv University Open Source
development course. There was a lecture there about CVS, which I interrupted
with some corrections and additions. After the lecture several people and I
introduced our projects to the students.
</p>

<p>
I gave a <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Freecell-Solver/project-intro/">10 minute introduction about Freecell Solver</a> (that was
accompanied by a demonstration of kpat solving Freecell). One of the
<a href="http://xparam.sourceforge.net/">Xparam</a> developers gave an overview
of his Xparam project. Shachar Shemesh said some words about Hamakor NPO, and
then introduced the WINE project to the students.
</p>

<p>
The students in the course are expected to choose a project to work on and to
perform about 300 hours of work each on it. The Xparam guy got three students
who were interested in the project and gave him their details. When I returned
home, and checked my E-mail, I found out from the course initiator that two
students expressed interest in Freecell Solver as well, and would probably
contact me. I did not hear from them yet, but I'm looking forward to it.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion and Perl Makefile.PL - problem and solution</b></p>

<p>
I now started to maintain LM-Solve using Subversion. However, after importing
the project into Subversion, I encountered a problem that I remembered
from Linux::Kernel::Module::Builder: the Makefile.PL also did something with
all the files under the .svn/ files. (and in my case even corrupted the working
copy).
</p>

<p>
A quick Googling made me realize that the solution was to install the
development snapshot of <a href="http://makemaker.org/">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a>
and use it instead. This has worked, and the Subversion resident Perl guru
told me the same thing on the IRC.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion Neon Usage</b></p>

<p>
Subversion has a problem of asking confirmation of a certificate for
as many times as the https:// path has path components, as it keeps
trying upward components. I wrote <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1390.shtml">a fix for this issue</a>, and posted
it to the Subversion development list. Ben Collins-Sussman <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1419.shtml">criticized it</a>
saying it was a workaround and maybe we are using Neon (the WebDAV client
library) wrong.
</p>

<p>
I inspected the code of Neon and found it does indeed return a plain
NE_ERROR error if the certificate's authenticity failed. This makes it
impossible to tell if we failed due to that or due to something else
altogether. We decided to wait for the Neon project head to tell us
what he makes of it, and what we should do.
</p>

<p><b>Dmoz.org Perl Tutorials Category Blues</b></p>

<p>
My application for editing the Dmoz.org Perl "FAQs, Help and Tutorials"
category was rejected for the third time. This time, there were problems
in the grammar of my submission (which I'll make sure won't happen next time)
and some vague critique of what is present in my existing categories. I should
probably go over them and fix it, and then try to apply again.
</p>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I got 86 as the final score in Introduction to Software Systems after I got
83 in the test. My final exam for this semester is two days from now, and I
hope it will go as well as the others.
</p>

<p>
There was a project brewing on writing a Freecell solver. I contacted its
supervisor today asking if I can take it next semester, but he said he already
filled the quota of projects he can give, and so I cannot. :-(.
</p>

<h2>25-Jul-2003</h2>

<p><b>Subversion and Neon Verdict</b></p>

<p>
At the end, the Subversion maintainer told us we can use the HTTP error code
to distinguish between the different kind of errors Neon is returning. So I
wrote an <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1500.shtml">updated patch</a> and Ben Collins-Sussman commited it. (thanks, Ben!). Now,
there's a part of me in the Subversion core.
</p>

<p><b>LM-Solve Re-work</b></p>

<p>
I spent part of the last couple of days reworking <proj>LM-Solve</proj>. I
started out <a href="http://stalker.iguide.co.il:8080/svn/lm-solve/">a
    Subversion repository for it</a>, changed its namespace to "Games::LMSolve",
added a lot of documentation, etc. It's also in CPAN now.
</p>

<p><b>Studies</b></p>

<p>
I took the test of Micro-computers on Wednesday. It went pretty well. I was
first worried that I won't have enough time to finish it, but then it turned
out I did have, even without the time extension. I still don't know what
my score is. This is my last test for this semester, so now I'm <b>free</b>!.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion</b></p>

<p>
I submitted a patch to add a <tt>--config-dir</tt> option to the subversion
command line clients to specify an alternate directory for the configuration
files. The first incarnation became out of date after a change in the code.
The <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-07/1666.shtml">second
    one</a> was also more encompassing, and modified more configuration
commands. I still have a small queue of patches that did not get accepted yet.
</p>

<h2>2-Aug-2003</h2>

<!--

* August Penguin II Event
* Reading - Games, Diversion and Perl Culture / TAO Unix Programming
* Subversion

* Dmoz.org category
-->

<p><b>August Penguin II</b></p>

<p>
I attended the August Penguin II event yesterday. It was very nice and
I met many people I knew there. At first Shachar Shemesh gave an instructive
presentation about the Linux activities in Israel the past year. Then, there
was a lecture about MOSIX by one of its Hebrew University workers. It was
very nice as well. Afterwards, <person>moshez</person> gave a lecture about
PyPy, instead of the Python internals lecture that appeared in the agenda.
Moshe is a very entertaining lecturer and the lecture went very well.
</p>

<p>
Then came the geek trivia, which pitted two groups of three "geeks" and "nerds"
against each other. It was very fun. And finally, came the key signing party
, which I took part in and signed the keys of 20 people or so.
</p>

<p>
There were a few glitches there, as far as I was concerned. First of all, I
discovered the building did not have any coolers and I had to drink water from
the taps of the restroom. Then, it was too cold in the lecture hall, and I
had to leave once or twice to regain my senses. Finally, my ride back to home,
disappeared during the key-signing party, which caused me to have to take the
bus again. But all in all, they did not spoil the fun.
</p>

<p>
After the event was over, I went back home, ate, and went to sign everybody's
key. It turned out <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg28626.html">some
    of the key could not be checked out of the servers I tried</a>. (read the
thread for more information). However, it turned out <person>mulix</person>
who organized the key signing party, prepared a keyring with all the keys,
and was about to send it to everyone for signing. Thus, I was able to sign
the rest of the keys.
</p>

<p><b>Freecell Solver</b></p>

<p>
I discovered a game of Simple Simon that could be solved by hand, but not
by Freecell Solver (which gave up after checking only the initial state). So
I set out to discover why. Apparently there was a function there which was
responsible for performing the initial move, only it had a bug. I only had
to remove one = from an <tt>&lt;=</tt> operator and the bug was fixed and
the game was solvable. Hah!
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I finished a large part (most?) of "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture :
Best of the Perl Journal". I also read the Freshmeat GUI Toolkits feature
and started reading ESR's "The Art of Unix Programming" which is very
interesting so far.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion</b></p>

<p>
I wrote a couple of tests for my Issue #1297 patch, and indeed the unpatched
Subversion failed them both. However, I was told the patch is not correct
because it does not handle some working copy parameters correctly.
</p>

<p><b>LM-Solve</b></p>

<p>
After releasing version 0.8.0 I discovered a bug and released version 0.8.1.
Now I think I did not document the Hexagonal Planks ID in the man page of
the executable so I'll need to release 0.8.2... :-). In any case, I also
revamped the <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lm-solve/">LM-Solve
    homepage</a> and now maintain it separately from my homepage.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I announced LM-Solve on Freshmeat.
</p>

<p><b>Dmoz.org</b></p>

<p>
I finally got permission to edit the Perl "FAQs, Help and Tutorials" category
on dmoz.org. I created a tutorials sub-category and will move all the
tutorials there. I might create other sub-categories there if I feel the
main one becomes too crowded. Let me know if there's anything you'd like to see
there.
</p>

<p><b>Lectures</b></p>

<p>
I prepared <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/Perl/Graham-Function/">a lecture about my solution to the Graham Function
    Perl Quiz of the Week</a>. This time I used PerlPoint, which enabled me
to quickly translate the summary into the lecture itself. Here's
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/3349">a discussion
    of it on Hackers-IL</a>.
</p>

<p>
I also prepared a summary (but not the slides themselves) for a lecture about
LM-Solve. Both are intended for the next Israeli Perl Mongers meeting.
</p>

<h2>7-Aug-2003</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I finished preparing <a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/lecture/LM-Solve/slides/">a lecture about LM-Solve</a>.
Then I worked on Subversion, and formed <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-08/0309.shtml">an updated patch to Issue #1297</a>.
This took a really long time (almost an entire day), but I'm really
happy that it's complete now. The fix had a small bug-let which was easy
to fix by adding a few lines.
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I sort of finished reading "Games, Diversions and Perl Culture", and
reached to the middle of "The Art of Unix Programming"'s chapter about
Mini-languages. TAOUP is a very interesting and entertaining book as is
the usual tradition with <person>esr</person>'s writings.
</p>

<p><b>Perl Meetings</b></p>

<p>
Gabor Szabo, who is the Israeli Perl Mongers leader is abroad, and as
it turned out Shlomo Yona, who was appointed to organize the meeting
instead is busy moving to a new apartment. Thus, <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2003-August/002765.html">I took the lead</a>
and decided on how to resolve the date, place, etc. issues for the next
meeting.
</p>

<p><b>Translucent Cursor</b></p>

<p>
I wanted a Knoppix-like translucent cursor for my X-Windows. So,
I asked around the IRC. Someone told me a similar effect exists in
the cursor_themes package found in the Mandrake Cooker. Looking there,
I found it. The cursor is darker than the Knoppix one, but still is
nice in a way. The package has other interesting themes, which I may
try out.
</p>

<h2>10-Aug-2003</h2>

<p><b>Subversion</b></p>

<p>
It turned out my updated patch was not <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-08/0403.shtml">acting according to the Subversion conventions</a>.
What I did wrong was not create temporary files, and not use the run log
mechanism to perform the operations that could be performed with it. So,
I sat on it on Friday, and wrote an <a href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-08/0420.shtml">updated patch (revision 5)</a>. This <a
    href="http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2003-08/0471.shtml">was
    applied</a>, and so I'm happy.
</p>

<p>
Today I took some time to prune my patches archive from patches that were
already applied.
</p>

<p><b>Haifa Apartment</b></p>

<p>
I met with the Apartment owners and one of my apartment-mates on Friday
to settle the payments for the apartment. There was a bit of a fuss between
my dad and the owner, about a payment for replacing a lock that was done
a year earlier. But other than that it went fine.
</p>

<p>
On the way back, I ate lunch at the MacDonald in the Yoqne'am Mall.
</p>

<p><b>Other Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
I worked and reviewed the lectures I wrote a bit. I've started adding missing
slides to the Gimp lecture I prepared, and hopefully, I'll put the full
lecture online soon. Other than that - not much.
</p>

<p><b>Hard-Disk Problems Revisited</b></p>

<p>
A few days ago, I got the same faulty noises when booting the hard disk. A
reboot did not help, but after I started Knoppix and mounted it, everything was
fine. Today, the same noises also happened, but this time the system could
load. Hmmm... I think I'll try to buy a new hard disk as soon as I can.
</p>

<h2>14-Aug-2003</h2>

<p><b>Hacktivity</b></p>

<p>
This and that. I've organized my <a href="http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/svn-patches/">Subversion patches directory</a> to
exclude patches that were already applied. That way, the other maintainers
can best know what needs to be applied. I've been looking for other Subversion
issues to work on, and found some candidates, but so far did not find the
time to work on it.
</p>

<p>
I also made progress in translating "Homesteading the Noosphere". A couple
of people contacted me with corrections to it, and I'm grateful for them.
Then, I made the data for my version of the Haifux lectures manager
up-to-date with recent lectures.
</p>

<p>
Finally I edited the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell">Wikipedia
   entry of Freecell</a> to make it less lame and more accurate than it was. I
   actually woke up in the morning thinking about Wikipedia and whether it
   mentions Freecell, checked it a bit afterwards, and in the evening changed
   it. ;-)
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I read part of the book about Statistical Physics and Thermodynamics I have
(I'm studying Thermo next semester). I also read the first two chapters
of "The House of Arden", after being reluctant to read it for a while.
</p>

<p><b>Free Software "Monopolies"</b></p>

<p>
<person>jlouis</person>, I don't really see free software "monopolies" as
a bad thing. It takes a lot of time and effort to create quality software,
and so it make sense one or a few packages will rise above the rest, and
concentrate most of the effort around them. If we take gcc, for example,
then everybody use it because it's a great and trustworthy compiler.
</p>

<p>
I don't see much point in switching to using anything else, just to make
an anti-monopolistic point. If gcc works, I am sticking with it. If something
better ever comes along, I might switch, but there isn't anything better
now. If you ask me, you'd better hack on gcc and make it an even better
compiler than it is now, then try to make a half-decent competition.
</p>

<p><b>Certification</b></p>

<p>
Certified <person>jlouis</person> as Apprentice because of the above and
other stuff I found on his homepage.
</p>

<h2>17-Aug-2003</h2>

<p><b>Perl Meeting</b></p>

<p>
Here's <a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2003-August/002851.html">a report I wrote</a> on the latest Israeli Perl Mongers, that took place on
Thursday. My father drove me to the meeting, and at first I bought some Burekas
in the nearby bakery. Then was the meeting. After the meeting Ronen Kfir drove
me and Kfir Lavy home. Kfir and I chatted for a long time and ate supper
at McDonalds. We discussed Linux and touched on many topics, including my
projects.
</p>

<p><b>Python Bindings</b></p>

<p>
I've been toying up with the idea of integrating Freecell Solver into PySol.
Since Freecell Solver is written in C, and PySol is a Python program, I had
to create bindings for it. At first I started using SWIG. This created very
C'ish APIs without much trace of a native language behaviour. Then I
realized it does not handle arrays well. So I set out
to write Python in the native bindings language. I consulted the Python
tutorial, the Python extensions writing manual, and the people at the #python
channel on FreeNode and eventually got things to work nicely enough.
</p>

<p>
I'm still a bit worried about memory leaks, but I suppose that Valgrind will
help me detect if they exist.
</p>

<p><b>Subversion Issue #1473</b></p>

<p>
To further test my Repos-&gt;WC file copy code, I wrote a test that set up
the svn:keywords property on the source file and then copied it. The result
was nothing less than a segfault. So I <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1473">filed an issue about it</a>. The problem is that
the translation is done without an entry existing in the .svn/entries file.
</p>

<p>
Ben Collins-Sussman and I discussed the best way to resolve it on IRC.
Our conclusion was that we should probably create another post-process routine
that will do the translation after the entry is created (which is already the
case, just that the translation is done beforehand). However, Ben thought
it was inelegant and so he wanted to consult the list.
</p>

<p><b>Reading</b></p>

<p>
I made some progress with "The Art of UNIX Programming". I also took the
book "Apache : The Definitive Guide" from the Perl Mongers book pool and
started reading it. I reached the beginning of the chapter on authentication.
</p>

<p><b>Biking</b></p>

<p>
Two days ago, when I biked, I noticed 1/3 of the way that a lot of air went
out from the back wheel. So, I returned. I don't know what causes it,
but I'll have to investigate, because I can't bike otherwise.
