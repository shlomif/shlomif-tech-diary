So, who the hell is Qoheleth?

Plan for an Illustrated (images/videos/etc.) screenplay.

It is titled "So, who the hell is Qoheleth?"

And it is about the guy who wrote https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes shortly after he finished writing it and publicised it?

Now i imagined him being called Yoseph (or Iosephus in Greek) and he was a Jew who lived in Damascus, around ~300 B.C. . He was young (18 y.o - maybe even less); unmarried and a virgin.

One day he enters a bet in which he tries to prove that he can write a worthy work of philosphy.

And he eventually produces the scroll - after about a month or two of work.

He wrote it originally in Hebrew, but recited it in Greek and Aramaic.

Well, maybe also hebrew and other langs.

Elench: anyway, he gets a standing ovation and people donate to him like crazy (back then philosophers were a kind of entertainers).

He was under constant pressure to get married already.

So he gives a few reruns.

And pretty soon the whole of Damascus is obsessed with him and his scroll.

And all the single girls want him for themselves.

Which drives him mad because pre-marital sex was considered non-kosher.

And he believes in intimacy.

At the start of the screenplay he gets asked "So who the hell is Qoheleth?" in
Aramaic.

Where "is" resembles "jehovah" a lot there.

Because yihiyeh is present/future.

So he says it could be King Solomon or someone else.

Some people thought that jehovah meant "He who is/will be"

So the guy who asked him that who's also Jewish tells him that while his
scroll was blasphemous, it brought a lot of "respect" to Jews.

And then he (Josephus, who is also the narrator) tells how every girl wants him
and they see lots of girls staring and lusting him.

Then he needs to pass through a group of three attractive Egyptian girls, and
he reflects on the fact that they are widely considered to be the most
desirable and beautiful girls back then. So he tells himself to stay strong
and to be non-chalant, and he goes through them only to hear them say
«A good name is better than good oil» (
http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm ) in perfect Aramaic, which causes
him to cry “Oh, God help Me!” out loud, and feel bad.

And then one of the Egyptian girls tells him:

Egyptian Girl #1: Hey, Josephus?

Josephus: Yes?

Egyptian Girl #1: I'm sorry, we were just teasing. You must get that a lot.

Josephus: That I do.

Egyptian Girl #1: I can feel for you. Anyway, we loved your "Qoheleth" thing
and we memorised the whole thing. It's awesome.

Josephus: Yes, most people say that.

Egyptian Girl #1: Listen my name is $NAME, I live in $LOCATION, and I'm still
unmarried. So, if you’re interested…

Josephus: Thanks for the offer, I’ll consider it.

Egyptian Girl #1: Thanks! My oldest brother is also infatuated with your
scroll, and I’m sure he’ll agree to the marriage.

Josephus: You know you’ll have to convert to Judaism?

Egyptian Girl #1: Yes, I’m cool with that.

Josephus: Thanks, I’ll consider it.
