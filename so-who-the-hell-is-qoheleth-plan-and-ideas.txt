So, who the hell is Qoheleth?

Plan for an Illustrated (images/videos/etc.) screenplay.

It is titled "So, who the hell is Qoheleth?"

Which drives him mad because pre-marital sex was considered non-kosher.

And he believes in intimacy.

At the start of the screenplay he gets asked "So who the hell is Qoheleth?" in

So the guy who asked him that who's also Jewish tells him that while his
scroll was blasphemous, it brought a lot of "respect" to Jews.

And then he (Josephus, who is also the narrator) tells how every girl wants him
and they see lots of girls staring and lusting him.
