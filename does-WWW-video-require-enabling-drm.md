# Does WWW Video Require Enabling DRM?

I am trying to get to the bottom of Cory Doctorow's claims in https://boingboing.net/2019/05/29/hoarding-software-freedom.html
that DRM is required for watching most web-based video.

Based on https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-drm I do not have the DRM module installed in
Firefox on Mageia Linux and yet I have no problem playing almost all YouTube videos: copyrighted ones,
VEVO ones, copyright-violating ones, covers, indies, Creative Commons licensed ones - the works.

I've now tested YouTube in the Mageia chromium-browser and it seems to work there as well.

I do not have a Netflix account, but others have told me it works fine in Firefox without DRM.

One should also note that a lot of web content is not dependent on video playback. Moreover,
I can use [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) to download media files which VLC/mpv/etc.
are happyy to play.

I live in Israel, so do residents of other countries have a different experience? Or was
Mr. Doctorow misled?
