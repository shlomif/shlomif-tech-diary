People are doubting me now. They always did. I also used to doubt myself. Now I no longer do. Part of the "problem" with being a "hacker king" (see http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/SummerNSA/A-SummerNSA-Reading/A-hashtag-SummerNSA-s-Reading/ ; http://shlomif.wikia.com/wiki/SummerNSA ) is that you "think 10, sometimes 20 steps ahead of everybody else" (see  http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Grand_Nagus ) and that you have the same ideas as everyone else, only 5 (or recently less) years earlier and are thus named a lunatic - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=same-ideas-as-everybody-else ).

So why do I no longer doubt myself? Because I realised by now that my crazy ideas tend to materialise:

* http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/ - the #Hezbollah as a benevolent organisation where people can come and leave as they please, and who is trying to stay out of Israel's way, and to enjoy the peace.

* http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/define-zionism/ - #Israel as a multi-national and non-discriminatory country (we're most of the way there) #Zionism #PostZionism

* http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/conclusions/#review--modus-operandi - male and female software/maths/open-content geeks as attractive, intelligent, socially capable, sexually assertive, and the "Alphas" (= most coveted and most popular members) of their society back in 2004/2005, well before the first episode of Big Bang Theory ( http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page ) which deliberately depicts the more "nerdcore" geeks as sexually unattractive (on the surface at least), and as socially challenged.
#GeekDomination #BBT

* http://www.advogato.org/article/361.html - call for world-editable screenplays for films back in 2001 well before the mainstream popularity of wikipedia and despite doubts such projects are now commonplace. #OpenContent

* http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/ - a belief that everyone should think they are the most powerful man or woman on Earth and that they are the messiah, and think that they will change the world and look forward instead of backward, #BelieveInYourself

* Most of my stories feature female heroines who are strong, competent, capable and yet - realistic, not flawless, and feminine.

* http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/ - the terminology of an "Alpha female" or "Alpha male" as a designator for the insurgent, rebellious, rule breaking, "bad girl", exciting, most-coveted female or male (first used to describe #JenniferLawrence there), to which my parents thought I was out of mind, but now is more acceptable.

So what happens next? I originally expected to stop being The Hacker King and pass the baton formally to #SummerGlau . Having quit prematurely, she took over , and as terminators go, terminated the whole obsession with The Hacker King. And now there can be more than one "A Hacker Monarchs". and I've now decided that I'm still "A Hacker Monarch"/"A Warrior Monarch" and a more awesome one than ever.

Humanity is facing many problems, and the gravest problem is what #NeoTech calls #mysticism:

««««««
Mysticism is defined as: 1. Any mental or physical attempt to recreate, evade, or alter reality through dishonesty, rationalizations, non sequiturs, emotions, deceptions, or force. 2. Any attempt to use the mind to create reality rather than to identify and integrate reality.
»»»»»»

And despite appearances to the contary #Buffy was to a large extent the antithesis of mysticism.

Neo-Tech keeps talking about such mythical "evil" people called #Mystics and #Neocheaters who are terminally infected with such mysticism but see https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/506754248411865089 :

After searching in vein for such neocheaters and mystics, I'm confused that getting yourself rid of most of your mysticism is not hard and naturally - very rewarding. See the Saladin method - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shlomif/Saladin_Style .

My plans for now are to become rich, famous, and truly acknowledged and the next J. K. Rowling - all without compromising on my ideals of openness, honesty, freedom, and strength , and pretending I'm someone I am not. I want to become a best selling author. I want to win the Academy Award's and other prestiguous prizes for best screenplay. I want to appear on the cover of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_%28magazine%29 with the caption "Sexiest Man Alive". And I'm not going to quit trying.

You may doubt that I can do it but remember Darth Vader’s words that «“The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force.”» http://cthulhu-cult.com/?p=241 . The force of life (or the Schwartz) is with me, and I'm a hacker king or a master hacker/master vampire. «Death cannot stop true love. All it can is delay it for a while» — http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/quotes .

Some people may wish to stop me. I heard someone say he'd like to drop an atomic bomb on Israel, where I currently reside - I don't wish to drop a nuke on anywhere, including not Tehran. But these people are powerless , and at most they can ban me from an Internet sub-forum , and thus be temporarily oblivious of my awesomeness.

Furthermore, like I noted earlier on Twitter, the true antithesis of love is not hate but indifference. One cynical (or mysticism prone) person talked for several hours to the operators of a channel on Freenode from whicih I was dequieted about my past sins and they convinced him that I was indeed evil (and damn right I am). If they didn't care about me and love me so much, would they have bothered? No, they would have not and so I concluded that they love me and care about me.

It is very fashionable to bitch about Ayn Rand, and to dismiss what she said throughout her life using many http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem attacks, but if people didn't agree with her and love her, would they have bothered? Not on your life! Rand was the Shit!

So I'm going to go full steam with my plan to:

1. Encourage sexual assertivity and social ability among women and men.

2. Make such descriptors as "hot", "girl", "chick", "sexy", "fox", "babe", etc. as positive compliments.

3. Rid the world of physical violence (not the so-called "verbal violence" which isn't really violence and unavoidable).

4. Make people not mind me or anyone else being "self-promoting" - and damn right proud of it.

5. Bring the end of days. "And among nations peace and good will among men".

Goliath - meet David (= me)!

Hail Saladin! Hackers/action heroes of the world unite! Long live the new and numerous Hacker Kings!
