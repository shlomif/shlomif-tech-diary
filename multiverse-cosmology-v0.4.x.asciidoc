== The demons:

The demons (aka "values", or "fairies" or "memes") are a race of epistemological (or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms[Platonic ideals]) organisms.

== Love / Knowledge / Creativity:

Re the tree of knowledge / pleasure/"love" / creativity, See https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/learning_more_from_inet_forums.xhtml[Education +++=+++ Entertainment +++=+++ Conception of Values] often by combining two or more memes.

Entertainment ____//www.shlomifish.org/meta/donate/e="strong">can mean

Both the link:#the-devils[devils] and the link:#the-angels[angels] could "make love" / experience pleasure / create new values.

Love *was not* the last word of memetics.

Like it or not, in the Selinaverse and Shlomifverse, pleasure (and a possible precluding temporary pain), education, and creativity/conception are intertwined.
While we can imagine realities where they are not, they will be... different.
