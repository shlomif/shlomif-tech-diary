> Seriously, I’m not a registered charity and only those may accept donations. For everyone else it’s just mislabelled, but still taxable income. The moment you put up a “donation” button, you are running a business, which automatically generates overhead costs. Getting five bucks once every blue moon with the implication of having to kiss the generous donor’s feet is simply not sustainable.

This is one of my biggest pet peeves about international law: that often businesses or individuals cannot easily accept donations. Given [laws are just guidelines anyway](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Rules_are_Just_Guidelines/) and are so large and numerous, and judges tend to use gut feeling, reason, anyway (see this film: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_but_Trouble_%281991_film%29 ), it just stops law-abiding people from giving or getting money.

I had to remove my PayPal donate button and inconvenience users by only providing a paypal ID. I recently was able to get a Patreon account though and hopefully can use it to reach my goals to relicense my body of works under permissive licences.

In my eyes, accountants have surpassed lawyers as a net strain on society. I tend to think (in a typical [post-scarcity Capitalistic fashion](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/amateur-modelled-commerce.xhtml)) that every real world entity should be able to transfer funds to every other entity for any reason. Money is now just digital integers on various computers (mainframes/etc.) around the world (and I approve). Note that I think [cryptocurrencies "solve" the wrong problem](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-fact-taylor-swift-6) and cost the world's people and computers an increasing amount of time, energy, and happiness.

As opposed to some cynics I [commend Trump](https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/wilwheaton.net-reply-about-trump-as-past-USA-president.md) for cancelling many superfluous regulations, and hope Biden can take it further. I also think Obama may have appeared to do little on the surface but actually encouraged ["Rosh Gadol"](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/) (or anti-[micromanagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement) / anti-overdomineering) throughout the American government.

I'm not implying all these people are fault-free, but I think [nobody is really "evil"](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/take2/#all_people_are_good), and the media has been trying to demonise everyone from Socrates, to Edison, to Walt Disney, to Sesame Street, to Natalie Portman, to Chuck Norris, to Emma Watson. ( And some people have demonised me as well, even though I've been trying very hard to not be cruel or unjust - it's just that I spoke my mind and often had lacking delivery. )
