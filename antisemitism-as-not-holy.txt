First of all, let me put these facts straight: I am a proud Jew (my parents are both ethnic Jews almost entirely as far as the eye can see, mother is Iraq-born and the father is Israeli-born to two Eastern European parents); a proud citizen and resident of Israel; my late and loved grandfather lost track of most of his Warsaw-based family in WWII and had to escape from the Nazis through Russia, and Persia; I have studied Judaism extensively as part of my (secular) school studies and later on as an adult in a mostly amateur way (Some people, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef , spent a life time mostly studying Judaism and still have not covered it all, and there is a case for being an amateur (see Paul Graham's http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html and related essays from that era), a polymath, and a pluralist, rather than a one-trick pony).

That put aside, I'm sick and tired of antisemitism being considered a taboo and "holy". So here are my denouncements of it:

1. Define “Zionism” - http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/define-zionism/ - concluding there is no single definition , and being somewhat opinionated, and claiming that Israelis should think they are responsible for the Israeli-Arab/ISraeli-Palestinian conflict (and vice versa), and not denounce people who are supposedly “anti-Israel” (And often just oppose its discriminatory nature) as “anti-Semitic”.

2. Captioned image about the Holocaust - https://www.flickr.com/photos/shlomif/8424748431/in/photolist- - also see the explanation in the comments. Most Israelis and Americans will no longer see what the big deal is all about, but a German humanities female intellectual I talked with was deeply offended by it at the time.

3. http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=third-sharp-perl-reich - a #perl log parodying two common idioms associated with the Holocaust.

4. [The Enemy and How I Helped to Fight it](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/) - a novella that criticises the Hizbullah and where the protagonist (a former Hizbullah agent) eventually meets Adolf Hitler and pwns him in a battle of wits. Thus comparing the Hizbullah at the time (1996ish) to the Nazis (there - I said it ).

5. http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/ - Buffy: A Few Good Slayers - my latest attempt to reconcile the big legacy that Buffy left, features a young (in the 10th grade) maternal Jewess ([kosher!](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=is-buffy-kosher) ) who is a self-proclaimed Jewish American Princess, and who loves the character of [Princess Vespa](http://spaceballs.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Vespa) from Spaceballs, and who is a [slayer](http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Slayer)-wannabe and ends up saving the day several times despite her lack of physical slaying capabilities.

6. In my two [Selinaverse](http://buffyfanfiction.wikia.com/wiki/Selinaverse) screenplays, there is a global Elders-of-Zion-like conspiracy of “vampires” - essentially geeks, amateurs, polymaths, or “hackers” - that is history-wide and universe wide. The stories feature such curiosities as a live and kicking Moses the Prophet, King Solomon, and Deborah the Prophet, who interact with the more recent and younger protagonists of my stories, as well as my own version of what happened in the Bible, and Jews who are not human (or even not humanoid).

7. In [Summerschool at the NSA](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/) (which is realism) there is a lot of avant-garde Judaica and Israelism, including a group of Yeshiva students who came to the production team of "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer" with some numereological insights about what will happen in Sunnydale next; Sarah Michelle Gellar having gone on an “awesome” date with a Chabad Yeshive pupil; the U.S. soldiers who guard the NSA noting that [Summer Glau](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/) is out of place there because the NSA headquarters area far cry from being the Israeli military with hot chicks all around and in uniforms; and finally Glau flirting with a soldier who escorts her by reciting [an old Israeli joke](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=the-cia-vs-the-kgb-vs-the-shin-bet), but still a funny one, about the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet .

------------

I suppose I can go on, but I won't. Thing is we should not be fixated about treating antisemitism, nazism, etc. as holy. We shouldn't rule out that there are interesting concepts, ideas, and memes, even in the most historically atrocious of belief systems (including  Christianity, Islam, Communism, and Nazism). Saying "Hitler said so at Mein Kampf" and doing the opposite thing is an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum .

It's important for idea systems to [not stagnate](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=larry-wall-all-truth-is-gods-truh) and constantly reach out and incorporate ideas from external places. If we treat antisemitism, nazism, holocaust denial, etc. as taboos, we prevent a more rational analysis of what's wrong and right with them.

Lately, I've spent some futile tens of minutes trying to convince the people on Freenode's #objectivism channel that Classical Randian Objectivism was no longer relevant as it is.
