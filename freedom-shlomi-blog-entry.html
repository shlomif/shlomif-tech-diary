<h2>"Free" and "Freedom" in Hebrew (and English)</h2>
<p>
By inspiration from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover">Passover</a>, which
celebrates the end of the Egyptian Jewish slavery, and by some inspiration
from <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fisl2005.html">what David A.
Wheeler wrote about the meanings of free in English</a>, I present to you
some non-professional philological study of the meanings
of "Free" and "Freedom" in Hebrew and English.
</p>

<p>
First of all, there are two ways to say "freedom" in Hebrew: "Hhofesh" (חופש)
and "Hherouth" (חרות). The double-h is my way of indicating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heth">"Hheth"</a>, which is similar
to the "kh" in "Khan" or the Spanish "j", but even more throaty when pronounced
correctly.
</p>

<p>
Now, "Hhofesh" means Freedom, while "Hherouth" is even stronger, and means something closer
to "liberty" in English, but probably not exactly the same. A free person (or a thing) is "Hhofshi" (in Singular Masculine form, other forms differ slightly), while I didn't hear
the word "Herouthi" used often. Instead one can say that someone is a "Ben-Horin" (i.e:
"son [or belongs to a people of] of free people."), which is probably the etymology
for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur">"Ben-Hur"</a>.
</p>

<p>
While "Herouth" is mostly limited to the liberty of a people or inidividuals, and is considered high language, "Hhofshi" is more disputed. It can naturally mean "libre" or free-from-oppression. But "Hhofesh" or "Hhufshah" also means vacation in Hebrew (like "Hahhofesh hagadol" (the big "Hhofseh") - which is the Hebrew name for the Summer vacation.) And so Hhofshi is sometimes applied to a person who is relieved of work,
education or other responsibilities (such as that of a spouse), even though it is
understood that it is not an exact meaning.
</p>

<p>
More recently, "Hhofshi" also started to be applied to "gratis", "costless" or
"on-the-house" commodities similar to the "free-as-in-free-beer" distinction. For example,
in Falafel stands, one often hears that the extras are "Hhufshi" meaning one can take as
much as they want to put in his Pitah-bread. This may have been an influence from English,
but as I noted, "Hhofesh" in Hebrew has not been restricted to mean freedom from oppression ("free-as-in-free-speech") either.
</p>

<p>
One doesn't often hear people using "Hhofshi" for "lacking" as in "Caffeine-free", although
that may also have become a bit more common lately. "Caffeine-free" is "Netol-caffeine" ("נטול-קפאין") in Hebrew, and one can also say "lelo kaffeine" (without Caffeine)
or "שאין בו קפאין" ("which doesn't have Caffeine" more or else) in certain contexts.
</p>

<p>
And I'd also like to stress the fact that "free" in English even in its more "libre"
meaning, can be used either for freedom-from-oppression or freedom-from-responsibilities.
If you value liberalism, you should try to use it only in the freedom-from-oppression
sense.
</p>

<p>
Happy Passover (a.k.a the Festival of Liberty in Israel) everyone!
