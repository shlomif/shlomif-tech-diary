[Meta] I really want to help fellow "openly bipolar" people, but due to a combination of other disabilities (namely poor motoric skills, stuttering, a hebrew accent, and poor diction) I find the prohibition to share URLs in replies and posts well... prohibitive. This is a silly rule, and you can search my site for "treating guidelines as dogma" or see youtube for "barbossa and the pirate code".

Please consider removing this policy, or I will have to leave. I will miss you, but you will likely miss me much moreâ€¦ #ableism
