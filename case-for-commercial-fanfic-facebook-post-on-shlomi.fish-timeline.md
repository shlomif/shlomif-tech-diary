Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as geeky imperatives (as of 2021)

https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/

Summary:

This essay attributes the perceived problems of "Hollywood"/the-film-industry, namely:

* Lack of original screenplays.

* Many big-name "unemployed" actors and actresses.

* "Franchise fatigue".

* An increase in the number of dystopian and/or pessimistic franchises and films.

To these culprits:

* The psychological, social, and economical shift towards competent and physically and intellectually attractive people being both geeks (= "amateurs"; loving their work or field of study; not doing it only for money) as well as hackers (= resourceful, rule benders, "action heroes", fate defiers).

* The recent cultural trend toward openness, freedom, sharing and remixing / standing on the shoulders of giants. E.g: Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), open/free content, "web 2.0", User-generated content.

* The film industry's requirement of accepting screenplays only in its draconian, finicky (and boring) format

* The fact that it was not communicative about the exact reasons why screenplays were rejected and how they can be improved.

* Its franchise territorialism (which hinders commercial crossovers).

* The fact that copyright is enforced on commercial use of characters, concepts, and worlds (and to an extent - texts).

* The recent antagonism against Real Person Fiction ( RPF ) due to an apparent "jinxing" of celebrities from being employable as actors in commercial films, and T. V. series.

It proposes a way forward, implementable by more than one party, that may hopefully make the film industry flourish just like the music industry (including "playing-for-fun" musicians), and the software industry. Here is the link to see the current plan and recommendations.
