<blockquote>
<p>Let’s make ("fan")-fiction great again!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Based on <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crippled_America">Donald
Trump</a>.)</p>
<p>This essay attributes the perceived problems of
"Hollywood"/the-film-industry, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lack of original screenplays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many big-name "unemployed" actors and actresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=
"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/20/12/29/1429227/disney-will-test-the-limits-of-franchise-fatigue-in-2021-and-2022">
"Franchise fatigue"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An increase in the number of dystopian and/or pessimistic
franchises and films.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To these culprits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The psychological, social, and economical shift towards
competent and physically and intellectually attractive people being
both <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#geek_def">geeks</a> (= <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur">"amateurs"</a>; loving
their work or field of study; not doing it only for money) as well
as <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#what_is_hacking">hackers</a> (= resourceful, rule
benders, "action heroes", fate defiers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recent cultural trend toward openness, freedom, sharing and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_(book)">remixing</a> /
<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants">
standing on the shoulders of giants</a>. E.g: <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free
and Open Source Software (FOSS)</a>, <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">open/free content</a>,

<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content">User-generated
content</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The film industry's requirement of accepting screenplays only in
its draconian, finicky (and boring) format</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its franchise territorialism (which hinders commercial <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)">crossovers</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that copyright is enforced on commercial use of
characters, concepts, and worlds (and to an extent - texts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recent antagonism against <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction">Real Person
Fiction ( RPF )</a> due to an apparent "jinxing" of celebrities
from being employable as actors in commercial films, and T. V.
series.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It proposes a way forward, implementable by more than one party,
that may hopefully make the film industry flourish just like the
music industry (including "playing-for-fun" musicians), and the
software industry. Here is the link to see <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#the-plan"><b>the current plan and recommendations</b></a>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> as a writer of fan-fiction, I may be biased in
handling what seems to be the lowest-hanging fruit for me. However,
I suspect this is also an important stepping stone towards other
aspects of world healing.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FFrag8ll85w"
allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<p>OK, ok <a href=
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFrag8ll85w">"Show Me the
Money!"</a>. Note that just like Asimov's <a href=
"https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/changing-the-seldon-plan/">
Seldon Plan</a>, this plan is not set in stone and <a href=
"https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ongoing-text.html">
we'll likely have to improvise ("play by ear"), or adapt it to the
circumstanses</a>. Moreover, they are just guidelines and
suggestions, not rules and demands. Furthermore, it is likely this
will not be the final challenge faced by the film industry and
fiction industry or humanity as a whole, so we should not rest on
our laurels.</p>
<p>Anyway, I suggest:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Screenplay readers to also accept screenplays in easier to write
and to get right formats, which should have open source, portable,
and easy-to-install, validators and <a href=
"https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters">linters</a>.
They should also accept and tolerate some minor errors. ( <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#hollywood_screenplay_format">Reference</a> ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copyright owners to relicense their franchises under permissive
licenses (possibly unilaterally). ( <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#freeing_franchises">Reference</a> ).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They can request to donate parts of the profits of derivative
works to them.</p>
</li>

<p>Big name actors and actresses to set up production companies

<li>
<p>Film / TV shows / etc. copyright owners should avoid trying to
<a href=
"https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/">stamp
out piracy</a>. In addition, legitimate low-res (720p/etc.)
versions of the complete films and TV show episodes should be
provided free of charge on YouTube/etc. This is for hyperlinking,
making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro">image
macros</a>, video macros, meme scenes, meme story arcs, or even
watching completely.</p>

<p>The second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy. We now have
several examples to prove that amateurs can surpass professionals,
when they have the right kind of system to channel their efforts.
Wikipedia may be the most famous. Experts have given Wikipedia
middling reviews, but they miss the critical point: it’s good
enough. And it’s free, which means people actually read it. On the
web, articles you have to pay for might as well not exist. Even if
you were willing to pay to read them yourself, you can’t link to
them. They’re not part of the conversation.</p>
