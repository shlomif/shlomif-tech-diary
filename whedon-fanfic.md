Re "and contradiction (first you blame the influence of fans for abusive behaviour in Hollywood, then you argue for a fan takeover).":

I'm not blaming the "fans". Fanartists will always feel obliged to materialise their ideas and in this day and age to publish them online. I recall reading in an an Israeli newspaper that IDF soldiers who wrote stories were anxious to show them off to their fellow soldiers.

Similarly [xkcd featured Summer Glau in its "venting" strip](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/406:_Venting). When I later wanted to write https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ , I trusted their judgement, and even depicted Glau as an xkcd fan.

We had no other choice.

I argued that professional screenwriters in Hollywood are geeks, hackers, and ergo: "open/free/remix" afficiandos and as a result increasingly resent the fact that they have to waste time de-fanficcing the screenplays, massaging them into the [mandated format](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/hollywood_screenplay_format.xhtml), or their submission silently rejected.

As an analogy, I suspect in [Ezekiel I](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16099/jewish/Chapter-1.htm), Ezekiel originally pieced together elements of polytheist or Jewish mysticism (as he perceived them directly or indirectly) to form an exaggerrated parody of visions of revelations.
