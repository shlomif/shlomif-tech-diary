<h2>2008-11-06: The Seven Deadly Sins of Arc</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc0.html">Arc</a> is Paul Graham's dialect
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language">LISP</a>,
that aimed to finally create a usable dialect of Lisp. It was released some
months ago, and I played with it and even contributed some code to the
Anarki Arc effort. In this post, I'd like to note why I think it has proved
to be mostly irrelevant and so quickly went into obscurity.
</p>

<p>
The Seven Deadly Sins of Arc are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<b>Not Many Exciting Features and Paradigms</b> - Arc may be more brief
than other Lisp dialects, and removed a lot of extraneous syntax, but it
doesn't seem to sport many exciting features and paradigms. It seems
like a Scheme-like-language only slightly better and slightly worse at
the same time.
</p>

<p>
Graham made a call for advice on his site, looking for ideas no how to improve
Arc, but it seems very few of them made it into the final language.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Standard State-of-the-Art Features are Missing</b> - Arc has no
built-in Object-Oriented Programing (OOP) system and it also lacks
namespaces. Both of these features are part of the absolute minimum
expected of any language today.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>No Version Control was Used for Arc</b> - when Graham published
<tt>arc0.tar</tt> (more about it later)
on his site, it was just a tar. He didn't publicise the URL for a version
control system that he used for work on Arc. And
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/distraction.html">in this article</a>
he claims he's recently been using a mostly-disconnected computer to do his
work, which indicates he's oblivious of the importance of using a remote
version control repository for constant work.
</p>

<p>
I don't have a lot of confidence in a program that's not kept under
version control, and neither do most professional programmers.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>No Automated Tests Suite</b> - Arc shipped without any automated tests.
If an obscure feature was broken, then Graham could not find out. Nor did
he have the specification-feature inherent in the automated test suite. Also
the lack of Test-Driven-Development (TDD) for its development was distressing.
Maybe that's what Graham calls <a href="http://arclanguage.org/">exploratory
    programming</a>â€¦
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
<b>Basic Usability is Missing</b>: there was no way to do <tt>./arc
    filename.arc</tt> to execute a file directly from the command line. I
had to add it to Anarki Arc, myself.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Weird Versioning</b> - the first released Arc version was <tt>arc0.tar</tt>.
The second was <tt>arc1.tar</tt> and the third was <tt>arc2.tar</tt>. Normally,
one would expect that <a
    href="http://catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s13.html">version
    1.0 of an open-source project would be very mature</a>, much less version
2.0, but
in Arc's case they were incremental releases, released after a short time.
</p>

<p>
So the versioning used by Graham is strange, not very conventional and
confusing.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Brevity Taken to Non-sensical Extremes</b> - Arc tries to be
as brief as possible, which is good, but it sometimes defies common sense
and convention. For example the <tt>(not)</tt> function in Arc is <tt>(no)</tt>
so the code reads <tt>(if (no a) (pr "a is false"))</tt> (is that even
English?).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Bonus! No line numbers in errors</b> - that's right, when something goes
wrong in an Arc progam, then you don't get a line number where it occured. How
can one write anything but toy programs this way? Of course, given that
executing files from the command line was not supported, it may not be
very surprising.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
In short, if you were hoping for a usable and modern dialect of Lisp, then
Arc is not the answer, and won't be without a lot of work. I was
told <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is much better than Arc, which
I have
little experience with, but may be better. (Although the fact that it targets
the JVM is somewhat of a turnoff).
</p>

<p>
But Arc, as it currently stands, is not the answer. Graham had a lot of time
to invest in polishing Arc before its release, but it's not polished at all.
The initial flurry of interest in Arc seems to be largely gone now, and it
seems unlikely that it will ever mature into something professional and
usable. Arc gave me some ideas on how to create a more usable Lisp, but it
otherwise lacked essential feature and is still lacking. I'm going to look
elsewhere for a usable Lisp dialect.
