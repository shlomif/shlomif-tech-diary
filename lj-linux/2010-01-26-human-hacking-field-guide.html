<p>
I've written <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/">a
    story about Linux and open-source development</a> titled "The Human
Hacking Field Guide". It is somewhat-non-realist realism fiction, with many
jokes sprinkled in. And its text, along with its DocBook/XML source is made
available
under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the
    Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike Licence</a> which explicitly
allows a lot of re-use.

I'd be happy to hear any comments. Here is the teaser:

This is a complete story titled "The Human Hacking Field Guide".
It tells the story of an unlikely female computer
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">hacker</a> (not a
computer intruder)-wannabe getting taught by an even more unlikely female
computer hacker. It takes place in Los Angeles, California and is written in
English.
