This post was written by inspiration from the Seinfeld story arc "George doing the opposite" ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SclV-UWM4Gw ) on YouTube and the similarly messaged song and videoclip "Brave" by Sara Breillis ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUQsqBqxoR4 ) where I say what I suggest people and organsitions care about should do now - because I care! Without censorship: whether copyright, anti-defamation, child safety, unnecessary tact, or even being accused of saying wrong, "lies" or blasphemous things. "We are our brothers' keepers" and that means we should be excellent to them, and advise them of any unhappiness that they may bring upon themselves.
