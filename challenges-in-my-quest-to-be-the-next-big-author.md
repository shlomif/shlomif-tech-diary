There are quite a few challenges that I'm facing in my quest to become the next big author.
Here are some of them:

1) Giving legitimacy to fan fiction ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction ),
crossovers ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction#Crossovers )/mashups , Real
Person Fiction ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction ), and other genres that
are now considered second-class by professionals as well as fans, due to the 20th
century fads of originality and professionalism. See Lawrence Lessig’s Remix book -
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_%28book%29 for more about why it's wrong.

2) Giving legitimacy to writing fiction as staccato screenplays and staccato
stories where there’s nothing extraneous instead of full-length novels. See
my stories and screenplays here for examples -
http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/ .

3) Giving legitimacy to writing my fiction using Screenplay-Text (
http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/ ) instead of
the Hollywood-blessed screenplay format which is not machine verifiable,
is errorprone and poorly supported by computer programs, and in general - sucks.
See: http://alistapart.com/article/unwebbable .

4) Giving legitimacy to redistributable and hackable works under
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license
under Creative Commons licences, which I use to license my fanfic, and are not
"all-rights-reserved".

5) Giving legitimacy to my own cultural heritage, that is based on the Israeli
take of Judaism, which is more Tanakh/Hebrew Bible-based than that of a typical
American Religious Jew, who is much more Talmud-oriented, and certainly is
very different from the Christian-flavoured cultural background on most
American cinema.

6) Battling a contemporary moral fashion against "self-promotion" and linking
to your own resources (or even giving any links whatsoever). See:

7) Giving legitimacy to portraying geeks, and especially female geeks, as
chic, intelligent, rational, sexy and attractive, competent and able, sexually
assertive, and socially capable — avoiding whatever possible dichotomy. As I
noted in https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/491689917919936513 : «To be an
attractive guy or girl, you need to radiate confidence and sexiness, and
this means being geeky [someone who likes what he does - an amateur], and
a hacker/action-hero. Therefore: hot people are geeks.».

See
[my definition](http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath)
of a hacker or an action hero, and why I believe even
http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Penny from The Big Bang Theory is a
wonderful hacker and action heroine.

8) Struggling against petty, intellectually immature minds, who cannot handle
my confidence or honesty and sincerity and as a result boycott/ban/devoiced/etc.
me instead of looking to themselves to see why they are hurt and which truth
they should admit - http://shlomif.wikia.com/wiki/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended .

9) Overcoming other more minor prejudice such as the fact that I'm an Israeli
secular Jew, who lives in Tel Aviv, a straight male, tends to be sexualised
which many cynical people perceive as sexist, can be a little socially awkward,
have bad diction, and tend to stutter a little.

I still believe that I should just deal with it and not complain because the
following people started as much less fortunate than I am, and still ended up
as superheroes:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain

-------------

I'm probably forgetting other challenges I face. However, I am not the man to
be afraid to try to succeed just because of these challenges. So I'm not going
to quit and will never give up. Goliath - meet David, I say. You shouldn't give
up on your dreams too.
