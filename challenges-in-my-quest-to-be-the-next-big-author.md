There are quite a few challenges that I'm facing in my quest to become the next big author.
Here are soem of them:

1) Giving legitimacy to fan fiction ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction ),
crossovers ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction#Crossovers )/mashups , Real
Person Fiction ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction ), and other genres that
are now considered second-class by professionals as well as fans, due to the 20th
century fads of originality and professionalism. See Lawrence Lessig’s Remix book -
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_%28book%29 for more about why it's wrong.

2) Giving legitimacy to writing fiction as staccato screenplays and staccato
stories where there’s nothing extraneous instead of full-length novels. See
my stories and screenplays here for examples -

3) Giving legitimacy to writing my fiction using Screenplay-Text (
http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/ ) instead of
the Hollywood-blessed screenplay format which is not machine verifiable,
errorprone, is poorly supported by computer programs, and in generally - sucks.

4) Giving legitimacy to redistributable and hackable works under
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license 
under Creative Commons licences, which I use to licence my fanfic, and are not
"all-rights-reserved".

5) Giving legitimacy to my own cultural heritage, that is based on the Israeli
take of Judaism, which is more Tanakh/Hebrew Bible-based than that of a typical
American Religious Jew, who is much more Talmud-oriented, and certainly is
very different from the Christian-flavoured cultural background on most
American cinema.
