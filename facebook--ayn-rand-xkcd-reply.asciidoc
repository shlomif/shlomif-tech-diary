thanks for your comment! I'm glad you enjoyed my site. I took you on your offer and donated 200 USD (reverse psychology can work sometime). As I note in my FAQ ( https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/fiction_books.xhtml ) , The Fountainhead is my favourite adult-oriented book, but I fully read it only once and shortly after found it necessary to parody it: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/ . I also kind of misinterpreted Rand's belief in Karma ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma#Comparable_concepts , I've now witnessed it as well ) and parodied it there.

I think Rand kinda fell victim to various philosophical trends and fads of her time, and she was sometimes misinterpreted or taken too much as gospel or anti-gospel. I am no longer an Objectivism purist and probably was never one subconsciously.

Re "xkcd" - it is indeed a legendary comics, and provided a lot of inspiration for many geeks like me. I no longer read every strip (guess the novelty is gone) and I think this strip - https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1357:_Free_Speech - was a low point
