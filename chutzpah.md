Title: Chuck Norris, Gay Marriage, and Chutzpah.

Here is a transcript of a chat with someone else after he told me that Chuck Norris was homphobic.

(09:33:11) Shlomi Fish: I think Chuck is OK with homosexual sex, just opposes gay marriage

(09:34:09) Shlomi Fish: My opinion about that is that there shouldn’t be a difference law-wise between a married couple and two [or more - heh] people living together, having sex and raising children.

(09:34:43) Shlomi Fish: In Denmark now, there are more children born to unmarried couples than those that are born to married couples.

(09:34:52) Shlomi Fish: I also support https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_migration

(09:36:39) Shlomi Fish: I think in Israel, there is a strong taboo against raising children outside marriage.

(09:37:25) Shlomi Fish: Divorces, even between unmarried couples may need to be arbitrated by the courts.

(09:37:56) Shlomi Fish: Ah! Someone on the Freenode programming channel is Peruvian and he has shared custody on a son with his ex-girlfriend.

(09:38:15) Shlomi Fish: She lets this son watch My Little Pony. :-)

(09:39:50) Shlomi Fish: Besides, I prefer people who have spite/Chutzpah/תעוזה and express opinions that I'm unhappy with, than those that are afraid of expressing any opinion whatsoever.

(09:40:21) Shlomi Fish: Everyone has vices.

Here's a little more: https://twitter.com/MelissaJoanHart (whom some of you may remember as the Emma Watson of the late 90s/Web 1.0) supports the American republican party and was criticised for tweeting the day prior to the recent elections to the U.S. president urging her Twitter followers to vote for the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney.

It's hard to know whether Romney would have been better than Obama, because they both cannot be presidents at the same time (though the candidates who lost can offer to help the president in hope of getting elected later, or just to help as ambassadors or activists of good will), but I appreciate her spite/"Chutzpah" and courage and the fact that she isn't afraid to speak her mind. Whatever you do or think, some people will take offence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey .

Some people have been trying to keep a "clean" online profile or avoid angering potential employers with any potential offence, and also been urging me to hide or remove important and incriminating details about me from my homepage. However, if I were an employer, I would actually look for people with some spite, even if I hold opposing opinions.

Another note: when doing advocacy, it is a good idea to take the Tanakh/Jewish Bible's pieces of advice of http://biblehub.com/text/proverbs/16-21.htm and http://biblehub.com/text/ecclesiastes/9-17.htm . If you believe in a cause, you can try setting a good example, and volunteering for your time for it, and showing the benefits of your way and making people feel excited by trying your way, instead of preaching against the alternative, scaring or disgusting people (e.g: , spreading (= Fear, uncertainty and doubt), and making people unhappy.

For example, while Alicia Silverstone ( https://twitter.com/AliciaSilv ) reportedly used to be a pretty militant PETA/animal-rights/etc. activist, but now her Twitter feed is much more pleasant to read. While it is debatable whether these causes are important, so are most other causes, and I respect Silverstone’s choices and priorities.

I recently decided to donate from my time and energy to help organise the next ICON science fiction/fantasy/etc. convention in Tel Aviv, Israel in Sukkoth - http://2014.iconfestival.org.il/ , and while I would be happy to receive some financial reimbursement for my time, I am content to do so without any payment, and that's because I enjoy such conventions and think they are important. To quote from Sarah Michelle Gellar's current Wikipedia Page:

«
Of her charitable pursuits, she says, "I started because my mother taught me a long time ago that even when you have nothing, there's ways to give back. And what you get in return for that is tenfold. But it was always hard because I couldn't do a lot. I couldn't do much more than just donate money when I was on the show because there wasn't time. And now that I have the time, it's amazing."

In my Star Trek fanfic screenplay - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/ - the Q Continuum is revealed to be a collective of very technologically advanced, but still not omnipotent, organisms, who have conquered death, and remain young forever, mind, body and soul. Nevertheless, Q, who is one of their leaders, notes that “We can always use more people. We could use all the help we can get.”.

I have a pet theory that many individuals, corporations, non-profits, and other organisations have an excessive amount of money in the bank, and just have a hard time finding volunteers or even employees to do everything they want, because not everyone has the right skillset, the motivation or the right attitude (and some people are just prejudiced against these various causes).
