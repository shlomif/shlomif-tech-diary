Hi!

First of all note that I am donating the money to you folks out of appreciation for the joy and inspiration you have given me (and the world at large). I don't expect anything immediate in return (just realise that sharing and voluntarily giving pays back in spades), but I request that you take my suggestions into consideration.

I hope I'm not being considered too domineering and meddling in other people's
affairs, but:

1. I encourage people to encourage others to criticise them ( http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/ ).

2. This is part of my "job" (= responsibility) as a "Messiah" / a "hacker monarch" / a "Pope" which is a role that I also encourage every man or woman, of any age to take: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gamedev--make-everyone--messiahs ; https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/ .

3. I care about the well being and happiness of everyone in the world.

I may be wrong, but request that you ponder my advice ( https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if--- ).

Anyway, judging by the video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Z3xhR_QE4 ) it seems that Dani as well as the 5 other singers are unhappy - and even saddenned by her decision to leave. They cite the fact that being part of the band is too time consuming and interferes with her passion in Graphics design. But I think it does not absolutely needs to be so.

Like the David vs. Goliath story shows ( https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional ), one needs to "hack", bend the rules/guidelines, be resourceful, defy one's "fate", find creative solutions, and use technology: both tangible, but also intellectual one.

E.g: If Dani would rather not go on tours, she can be filmed, recorded and be displayed from the comfort of her home. Or if there are too many covers that you are interested in producing, then either pick up ones based on auctions ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJrqpR_7VSo ) or roll dice. Or Dani may be absent from some recordings. Etc.

As a fellow creator I can attest that I am often overflowing with many ideas for new stuff to write or older stuff to improve. But I try to prioritise the most important (or most fun) tasks first. Note however that I market myself as a writer, humorist, software developer, and unskillful graphics and video editor rather than as a musician. (I have some recordings of songs on my YouTube channel, but I admit many of them are worse than most of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Sings 's stuff.)

Dani was one of my favourites singers in part due to her playfulness, the fact that she had sang off key in some early videos, and she being a lean&mean rapper. So I'd hate to see her go.

Do note that I'd also appreciate some social media publicity for my web site (  https://www.shlomifish.org/ ; https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/ ) and my other social media outlets ( https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/ ) and my latest (CC-BY-licensed) attempt to continue revolutionize the film/drama/fiction/gaming industry: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/ . As I believe I to identify there, most talented, skillful, competent, and attractive individuals of any gender, age, belief or qualities, are increasingly both geeks (= "amateur"; love what they do) and hackers (= "action heroes"; bending or challenging the "rules", not accepting their fate, etc.).
With love from Tel Aviv, Israel,
