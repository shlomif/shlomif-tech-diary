I screwed up big time. I thought that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau , my beloved (and likely yours by now) actress and geek was going to be the next "Alpha Female" - similar to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar (who ruled Web 1.0
(~1996-2001) supreme, despite her mostly unaestheic face),
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe (need I say more?),
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miley_Cyrus ,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman , and most recently - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence (â™¥). This is a very fine 
role and influential, but it's not as good as that of the Warrior King or
Warrior Queen. (Warrior Monarch?).

So what am I talking about? The warrior king or queen does war and kicks butt. But contrary to common belief, he bring happiness, life, pleasure,
and love. And it doesn't have to be done by force or combat.

The first warrior king I can think of was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin , who had a long-misunderstood approach
to psychological warfare involving mercy, nobility, and mutual respect
, which was able to cure the Knights Templar, who were some crazy ass
bastards, not completly unlike, but even worse than today's NSA ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency ).

Some other notable Warrior Kings and Queens:
