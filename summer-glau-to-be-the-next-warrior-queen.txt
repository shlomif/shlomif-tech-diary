I screwed up big time. I thought that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau , my beloved (and likely yours by now) actress and geek was going to be the next "Alpha Female" - similar to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar (who ruled Web 1.0
(~1996-2001) supreme, despite her mostly unaestheic face),
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe (need I say more?),
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miley_Cyrus ,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman , and most recently - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence (♥). This is a very fine 
role and influential, but it's not as good as that of the Warrior King or
Warrior Queen. (Warrior Monarch?).

So what am I talking about? The warrior king or queen does war and kicks butt. But contrary to common belief, he bring happiness, life, pleasure,
and love. And it doesn't have to be done by force or combat.

The first warrior king I can think of was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin , who had a long-misunderstood approach
to psychological warfare involving mercy, nobility, and mutual respect
, which was able to cure the Knights Templar, who were some crazy ass
bastards, not completly unlike, but even worse than today's NSA ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency ).

Some other notable Warrior Kings and Queens:

* 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith - whose brave, naïve, and
spectacular, act of writing a letter to the General Secretary of the USSR
helped end the cold war. Notable for being both female and underage.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne - who became the most famous
man of the 19th century by writing about the possibilities and good that
technology brings.

* http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Buffy_Summers - the first female fighting
girl (and a fictional one) that girls saw as a role model, and close
to every non-macho man on the planet found highly attractive. Sexy, powerful, feminine and vulnerable. Perfection achieved. (And naturally, this role
made its actress the alpha female.)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall - the "invisible" of the open
source movement. Created the extremely influential Perl programming language,
the UNIX patch program (which was arguably more important than all of Perl), 
and an inspiring philosopher and a gifted public speaker.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard - the sexy, gentle, merciful
, tactful and resourceful, fictional captain of the starship USS
Enterprise, who inspired generations of leaders from the late 80s onward, blah blah.

But who is the contemporary Warrior King or Queen? Buffy stopped airing,
and lost momentum after Buffy et al graduated and the sexy, insurgent, and
awe-inspiring slayer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_%28Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer%29 was left
in a comma and stopped being a major character. The web 1.0 was soon to end anyhow. 

Today we're at Web 2.0, which brought us a lot of open "content": 
Chuck Norris factoids (which are
a much more awesome warrior than Mr. Norris ever was, and which he took to
his advantage and made a huge comeback past his 70s), many covers of songs
on YouTube, some really crazy crossover fiction - see my stories http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/ for an example, lots of reality
shows with many artists rising into prominence, a very honest and
in-your-face new Muppets film - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets_%28film%29 - and many other great
and honest films, such as the Kung Fu Pandas, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_%28film%29 and naturally
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook ; it also brought
us the wikipedias, and other wikis (such as the many wikias), which are a great source of knowledge, some great forums for Questions&Answers 
and discussions like http://reddit.com/ or the http://stackexchange.com/ 
network and naturally even https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat has made a comeback with Freenode and other active networks.

Finally, it brought us social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google-Plus
which are the Socrates... ehhm Television of the Nineties in being
accused of spoiling the youth - http://www.robcottingham.ca/cartoon/archive/this-brain-this-brain-fire/ .

There are some problems though and here are the two major ones:

1. We have no poster boy and/or poster girl.

2. We have the NSA, a bunch of mentally-ill losers who consistenly failed
to publish and are now perishing - see http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/ , and whom Snowden (a honest, brave, intelligent, but rash man) published their claims which
made everyone paranoid.

It's hard to know whether these claims are true or not without
getting the NSA to both become normal again (using a combination of
Saladin's benevolent psychological warfare and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy ) and getting
them to be more transparent and benevolent. 

And that's where my “Summerschool at the NSA” effort comes in - http://www.advogato.org/article/1079.html - and it stars Summer Glau as
herself. Only it won't make her the alpha female (or at least not the alpha 
female alone) - it will make her the Warrior Queen! Perhaps I will
step out from being the invisible and become a fellow warrior monarch.
Perhaps not and I'll remain obscure. It doesn't matter.

Why do we do this to Ms. Glau?
