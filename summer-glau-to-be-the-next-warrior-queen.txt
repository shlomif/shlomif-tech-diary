I screwed up big time. I thought that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau , my beloved (and likely yours by now) actress and geek was going to be the next "Alpha Female" - similar to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar (who ruled Web 1.0
(~1996-2001) supreme, despite her mostly unaestheic face),
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe (need I say more?),
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miley_Cyrus ,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman , and most recently - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence (♥). This is a very fine
role and influential, but it's not as good as that of the Warrior King or
Warrior Queen. (Warrior Monarch?).

So what am I talking about? The warrior king or queen does war and kicks butt. But contrary to common belief, he bring happiness, life, pleasure,
and love. And it doesn't have to be done by force or combat.

The first warrior king I can think of was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin , who had a long-misunderstood approach
to psychological warfare involving mercy, nobility, and mutual respect
, which was able to cure the Knights Templar, who were some crazy ass
bastards, not completly unlike, but even worse than today's NSA ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency ).

Some other notable Warrior Kings and Queens:

*
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith - whose brave, naïve, and
spectacular, act of writing a letter to the General Secretary of the USSR
helped end the cold war. Notable for being both female and underage.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne - who became the most famous
man of the 19th century by writing about the possibilities and good that
technology brings.

* http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Buffy_Summers - the first female fighting
girl (and a fictional one) that girls saw as a role model, and close
to every non-macho man on the planet found highly attractive. Sexy, powerful, feminine and vulnerable. Perfection achieved. (And naturally, this role
made its actress the alpha female.)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall - the "invisible" of the open
source movement. Created the extremely influential Perl programming language,
the UNIX patch program (which was arguably more important than all of Perl),
and an inspiring philosopher and a gifted public speaker.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard - the sexy, gentle, merciful
, tactful and resourceful, fictional captain of the starship USS
Enterprise, who inspired generations of leaders from the late 80s onward, blah blah.

----------

But who is the contemporary Warrior King or Queen? Buffy stopped airing,
and lost momentum after Buffy et al graduated and the sexy, insurgent, and
awe-inspiring slayer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_%28Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer%29 was left
in a comma and stopped being a major character. The web 1.0 was soon to end anyhow.

Today we're at Web 2.0, which brought us a lot of open "content":
Chuck Norris factoids (which are
a much more awesome warrior than Mr. Norris ever was, and which he took to
his advantage and made a huge comeback past his 70s), many covers of songs
on YouTube, some really crazy crossover fiction - see my stories http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/ for an example, lots of reality
shows with many artists rising into prominence, a very honest and
in-your-face new Muppets film - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets_%28film%29 - and many other great
and honest films, such as the Kung Fu Pandas, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_%28film%29 and naturally
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook ; it also brought
us the wikipedias, and other wikis (such as the many wikias), which are a great source of knowledge, some great forums for Questions&Answers
and discussions like http://reddit.com/ or the http://stackexchange.com/
network and naturally even https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat has made a comeback with Freenode and other active networks.

Finally, it brought us social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google-Plus
which are the Socrates... ehhm Television of the Nineties in being
accused of spoiling the youth - http://www.robcottingham.ca/cartoon/archive/this-brain-this-brain-fire/ .

There are some problems though and here are the two major ones:

1. We have no poster boy and/or poster girl.

2. We have the NSA, a bunch of mentally-ill losers who consistenly failed
to publish and are now perishing - see http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/ , and whom Snowden (a honest, brave, intelligent, but rash man) published their claims which
made everyone paranoid.

It's hard to know whether these claims are true or not without
getting the NSA to both become normal again (using a combination of
Saladin's benevolent psychological warfare and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy ) and getting
them to be more transparent and benevolent.

And that's where my “Summerschool at the NSA” effort comes in - http://www.advogato.org/article/1079.html - and it stars Summer Glau as
herself. Only it won't make her the alpha female (or at least not the alpha
female alone) - it will make her the Warrior Queen! Perhaps I will
step out from being the invisible and become a fellow warrior monarch.
Perhaps not and I'll remain obscure. It doesn't matter.

Why do we do this to Ms. Glau? Was it a coincidence that she
shares the same initials as Sarah (Michelle) Gellar who portrayed
Buffy Summers? Was it a coincidence that her first name ("Summer")
is akin to the last name of Buffy Summers? (Who like I said was a Warrior
Queen at the time?) Was it a coincidence that you were picked to be
featured in the xkcd webcomic? Was it a coincidence that I called my old
meme "Summerschool at the NSA"?

Lots of coincidences. Furthermore, if we are to believe the wisdom of http://kungfupanda.wikia.com/wiki/Oogway from the wonderful film
Kung Fu Panda, “there are no coincidences”. My father read a book which
noted that people who believe they have good luck are proactively bringing
it to themselves. I think I have good luck and went on to fill my site
and other places in the Internet with my anti-cynical wisdom, and Ms. Glau likely proactively is working for her good fortune. So I think that she
deserves the great honour of vanquishing the NSA, whatever her faults and
imperfections may be.

Note that I don't need her cooperation. Having licensed the screenplay
under CC-by, and taking actions to solicit people filming it, and using
means of both online and offline publicity and marketing (all "honest"
, not what I consider dishonest marketing). And I'm fine with other
actresses playing her and/or Sarah Michelle Gellar. With enough
persistence and acceptance (just like Saladin) and some money
I hope I will eventually win. And I'll likely be content enough with a
simple voiced vector-graphics animation or a poorly produced film by
some amateur 16 years old film makers (give or take 120 years).

Is Ms. Glau ready for this? I don't know, but I almost sure she is. Chuck
Norris approved of his facts, some of which defy every common sense, are
positively blasphemous to each and every religion out there, and Rick
Astley approved of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling . Remixing
and the pleasure it brings is taking over the Interconnected world by storm,
and "Summerschool at the NSA" will be a zany, yet extremely serious remix
that will hopefully pull the plug on the gravest enemy of the Internet world:
the NSA, and their delusions.

Being a superb warrior/hacker/geek/slayer/dispeller/terminator/ass-kicker/etc. myself I have been a subject of much attacks too: people criticised me being proud of my work and publcising it; they added adjectives
to describe my way of going. I was outcast, banned, kicked, and condemned
for being honest and sincere. Some cynical people objected to my unyielded belief that people can grow and get rid of their past. They considered my
many faults as objects of ridicule. I was criticised for admiring such
postively superheroic people of history, myth, and present (which I aim
to be one of them). I was criticised of any aspect of my existence, and got
picked on words I said. In a sense, I was too tactless.

One thing I do know is that: 1. I constantly grow in my skills and capacity
for happiness. 2. I become wiser as I grow older, in part because I'm wise
enough to stay wise. 3. I realise that the reasons people who are good
are full of doubts is that they are good because they are full of doubts. I
can't tell you what I'll believe in 1 year from now. But I intend to
remain an idealist, despite my many imperfections.

The future will remain imperfect, but we can make it somewhat less imperfect.
I actually feel relieved that Summer Glau will become the Warrior Monarch
instead or as well as me. (And BTW, she can kick Chuck Norris's ass -
http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/ - HOT!!!). But it's
almost probable she will not remain the Warrior Monarch forever, because
one day, a boy or a girl, a human or a non-human, real or fictional, will
show her who's boss. And it may be a previous warrior king or warrior queen who's made a comeback, or a “nobody” who rose to immediate fame. Sic transit
gloria mundi.

And it is my hope that she'll accept her "fate", and realise that she will
still remain a kick-ass ass-kicker despite being "old news". I'm going to
hone my skills and work on publicity (including buying web ads), and
continue to remix and hope to be remixed. But I know of people who are
much better than me at being writers, or essayists/philosophers, or are
friendlier than me. But I am not trying to be the best of the best of best.
I'm just trying to be a cool and smashing Shlomi Fish/Shlomif/Rindolf.

And as much as I admire the great heroes of the past, I think I know better
than them how to survive in the zany and awesome reality of 2014. Classical
Randian Objectivism has died, because like Stoicism or Classical Aristotleanism, or many 20th century cults died, it is now antiquated. Objectivism, however, is still alive and kicking, and I'm now a Rindolfist,
where Rindolfism is my one-man, dynamic, idea system.

Today at 37, I feel younger and more alive than ever, and feel kinda like
these songs:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlV7RhT6zHs - "I'm not a girl, not yet a  woman" - by Britney Spears.

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y_KJAg8bHI - "Wake me up" - by Avicii (a
very smart song on so many levels).

It took me 37 years to find myself, and I still have many doubts and learn
new things. But at least I created many works of fiction, code, and non-fiction, helped countless of people, made many friends, turned some enemies
into friends, helped improve the world at least a little, mostly enjoyed it considerably, and am now much wiser than before, and a much more badass
asskicker.

----------------

This essay took a different turn than I expected. However, it was a nice
mini-journey. Although I am a bit nostalgic for the 1990s when I grew up,
I'm still not ready to trade the Wikipedias, the wikias, and other wikis
for GeoCities, Yahoo and Altavista, or worse the Encyclopaedias of my time,
modern day forums and social networks for Usenet, and what were the mailing
lists and IRC networks of its time,
http://www.shlomifish.org/ of today for http://old-1998-site.shlomifish.org/ ,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie for Britney Spears or even
Madonna, or me for my younger and far more prejudiced and foolish self. We
are all simply better.
