Open Letter to Summer Glau: Don't be Afraid of Being Criticised; Try to be
criticised as much as possible!

Previously on /r/SummerGlau , I asked why Summer isn't more active online and
received two answers:

1. That she is clueless around electronic devices. I know for a fact that
it's no longer true because people reported her to have been emailing some of
her fans in the past, and also she had a private facebook account (that was
repetitively cracked). People like Summer can change and gain new abilities.

2. That she is afraid of being hurt and offended from online critics, in part
due to her history as a professional ballerina-wannabe.

Now assuming #2 is true let me give an important ammendment to what I
previously said about handling criticism. What I realised after crossing over
several sources, is that one should
[Encourage criticism and try to be offended](http://shlomif.wikia.com/wiki/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended)
because that is a clear indication that the critique uncovered a grain of
truth, which you refuse to admit but should and because every great truth
once started as a blasphemy.
