The aptly named "Little Boy" bomb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy
weighed 4.4 tons and contained 64 kilograms of Uranium, and didn't destroy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima which was smaller then, and some
locals survived. Furthermore, a prototype of it was tested in the western
USA desert.
