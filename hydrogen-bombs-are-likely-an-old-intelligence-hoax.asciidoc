The aptly named "Little Boy" bomb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy
weighed 4.4 tons and contained 64 kilograms of Uranium, and didn't destroy
the whole of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima which was smaller then, and some
locals survived. Furthermore, a prototype of it was tested in the western
USA desert.

This young lady, made to look Israeli-like, is sitting on
a small nuclear bomb. Even if it was made of pure
Plotunium, I doubt it could wipe an entire middle eastern
city.

As this segment shows shooting missiles from
a fighter jet does not detonate small nuclear bombs.
