This is just a hypothesis! If you happen to gain access to an actual atomic bomb, then please https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22don%27t+be+a+dick%22+wheaton%27s+law&atb=v140-1&ia=web[don't be a dick] and detonate it wherever:

The aptly named "Little Boy" bomb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy
weighed 4.4 tons and contained 64 kilograms of Uranium, and didn't destroy
the whole of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima which was smaller then, and some
locals survived. Furthermore, a prototype of it was tested in the western
USA desert.

This young lady, made to look mock-Israeli-like, is sitting on
a small nuclear bomb. Even if it was made of pure
Plotunium, I doubt it could wipe an entire middle eastern
city.

As this segment shows shooting missiles from
a fighter jet does not detonate small nuclear bombs.

How come https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran[Iran] has been working
on an Atomic Bomb for 31 years now? It took https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project[the Manhattan Project]
less than 4 years. Iran wishes the uninformed to think they are developing
an atomic bomb but have no intention of actually developing one.

The Iranians cannot be stupid enough to allow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet[Stuxnet] to happen given they were aware of Microsoft Windows being vulnerable in the 2000s. I'm fairly certain they cooperated with Israel/USA and possibly large parts of the greater international intelligence community.

I suspect nuclear bombs just contain sand, with a small amount of radiation emitting nuclear isotopes.

Dispelling some myths about Israel:

1. Most Israeli civilians are not soldiers in active duty (or policemen for that matter)

2. Many Israelis are exempt from IDF service. See: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/idf_service.xhtml . This includes members of some ethnic groups; people with medical problems (e.g: a history of clinical depressions); recently some have been exempt due to "excess of personnel".

3. Most Israeli soldiers do not carry guns (as most of them are not combat fighters), nor do the vast majority of Israeli civilians (who will need a very good reason to get a gun license).

4. Neither Israelis nor the Palestinians have been genociding each other: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/is_it_true_that_israel_genocides_palestinians.xhtml . Whatever acts of murder and brutality did not exceed the population growth.

5. Not all Israelis are https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/are_you_an_agent.xhtml[Mossad agents] (this document is just my attempt at hobbyist espionage based on publicly-accessible sources) and naturally most of them are a far cry from having received https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Don%27t_Mess_with_the_Zohan["Zohan"-like] commando training. (But see:
https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ongoing-text.html#summer%5fglau%5fpresents%5f%5fthe%5ftalk%5f%5famateur%5ffighters[Amateur fighters] and https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-english-play-to-lose["Play to Lose"] .)

6. Most of Israel is safe, and more Israelis have been killed by road accidents than by wars and terrorism combined.
