Hydrogen bombs
--------------

The aptly named "Little Boy" bomb: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy weighed 4.4 tons
and contained 64 kilograms of Uranium, and didn't destroy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima
which was smaller then, and some locals survived. Furthermore, a prototype of it was tested
in the western .us desert.
