<h2>2009-10-23: Comparison of Directory Tree Traversers in Various Languages</h2>

<p>
This is another installment in my series of articles about
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/File-Find-Object/">File-Find-Object</a>.
This time what I'll do is look at the APIs provided by other languages for
recursively traversing directory trees to see if we can gain any future
insights. Let's start with the prominent Perl APIs:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
You probably all know <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?File::Find"><b>File::Find</b></a>,
which is the built-in Perl 5 API for directory tree traversal.
As I noted earlier in a previous post,
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/29315.html">it has
several severe design limitations</a>, including not having an iterative
interface, and as a result not being capable of interrupted in the middle
very easily, it cannot be instantiated and used to traverse an arbitrary
number of directory trees in one process (due to its use of global variables)
and only gives three variables - <tt>$File::Find::name</tt>,
<tt>$File::Find::dir</tt> and <tt>$_</tt> as arguments (whose meaning
depend on the value of the <tt>no_chdir</tt> parameter).
</p>

<p>
This brings us to no_chdir which controls whether or not it changes to
the directory containing the directory or file being reported. I can't think
of any case where it would be desirable to cd to sub-directories or up, and
in File-Find-Object Nanardon and I made a design decision of not changing
directory ever.
</p>

<p>
The internals of File::Find are incredibly messy, hard to follow, and contain
two nearly identical pieces of code that are chosen based on one of the
flags. It also doen't use File::Spec, but instead relies on its own ad-hoc
portable path mangling.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Next/"><b>File-Next</b></a>
is Andy Lester's iterative directory traverser, that among other things is
used in his <a href="http://betterthangrep.com/">ack
grep-replacement tool</a>. File::Next provides some iterative interfaces,
but cannot be instantiated, and still uses several global variables, and
uses several non-Object Oriented / non-exported functions. It also seems
to provide some abstractions over the basic File::Find functionality which
was implemented as a part of File-Find-Rule in File::Find's case,
and later on File-Find-Object-Rule in File-Find-Object's case.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
And naturally there's <b>File-Find-Object</b>, which is capable of
instantiation, has an iterative interface and also returns result objects
with some meta-data about the files and filenames.
</p>
<p>
Lately, I've become a little unhappy with the interface, as one can control
the future traversal only of the deepest level, and not of an upper level
in the tree. As a result, pruning several directories at once may require
some relatively complex logic in higher-level code. I believe this can
be remedied by providing some extra methods without breaking the external API.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Naturally, there are many abstractions on CPAN above these module like
File-Find-Rule, or File-Find-Object-Rule, but they are out of scope of this
post.
</p>

<p>
Now let's move on to the APIs provided by other languages and environments:
