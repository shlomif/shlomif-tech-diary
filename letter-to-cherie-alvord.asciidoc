Hi Cherie!

Note that this email is an open letter, but you may opt to keep the replies private.

Back when I contacted you about Tiffany's role in Queen Padmé Tales ( https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/ ), you told me that she plans to record origina songs. However, she hasn't uploaded either them or covers. (And there are many good songs that she hasn't covered yet.)

Moreover, some of her Instagram→Twitter posts featured a badly photoshopped orange hair colour!

Please note that I have a full-blown conspiracy hypothesis: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/#see-also . But I'm playing by the rules while bending them a little.

So what is going on?

Sincerely yours,

— Shlomi Fish
