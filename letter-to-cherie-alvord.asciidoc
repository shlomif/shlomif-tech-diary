Hi Cherie!

Note that this email is an open letter, but you may opt to keep the replies private.

Back when i contacted you about Tiffany's role in Queen Padm√© Tales ( https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/ ), you told me that she plans to record origina songs. however, she hasn't uploaded either them or covers. (And there are many good songs that she hasn't covered yet.)
