Hi srlamb! Thanks for your response and your help.
</p>

<p>
1. As I found now, the host in question ("www.shlomifish.org") does
not answer to pings even if I ssh there and ping localhost.
</p>

<p>
2. Interesting. I wonder what can cause that. I should note that we replaced
a NAT/router box around the time these problems started to appear. Maybe this
box is buggy in this respect. One thing I can do is make a packet capture
of the nearby Windows computer for a "lynx http://www.shlomifish.org/" command
after it is broken on my Linux computer.
</p>

<p>
7. I see.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I noticed yesterday was that after the problem appeared I still
had an ssh connection open, and it worked perfectly ("ls -lR" on my home
directory there and all). After I disconnected it, I was able to reconnect
again (after one failed attempt), but not more.
