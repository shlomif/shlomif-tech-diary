<h1>The Neo-Tech Constitution</h1>

<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>
The purpose of human life is to
prosper and live happily.  The function of society is to protect those
conditions that let all individuals achieve prosperity and happiness.  Those
conditions can be delivered by a constitution that prohibits the use of
initiatory force or coercion by any person, group, or government against any
individual:
</p>

<h2>The Constitution</h2>

<p>
<b>Article 1:</b> No person, group of persons, or government may
initiate force, threat of force, or fraud against the person or property of
any individual.
</p>
<p>
<b>Article 2:</b> Force may be morally and legally used only in defense
against those who violate Article 1.
</p>
<p>
<b>Article 3:</b> No exception
shall ever exist to Articles 1 &amp; 2.
</p>
<p>
The Neo-Tech Constitution rests on six axioms:
</p>
<ol>
<li>	Values exist only relative to life.  </li>
<li>
Whatever benefits a living organism is a value to that organism.  Whatever
harms a living organism is a disvalue to that organism.
</li>
<li>
The basic value
against which all values are measured is the conscious individual.
</li>
<li>
Morals
relate only to conscious individuals.
</li>
<li>
Immoral actions arise from
individuals choosing to harm others through force, fraud, deception, coercion
-- or from individuals choosing to usurp, attack, or destroy values earned by
others.
</li>
<li>
Moral actions arise from individuals choosing to benefit others
by competitively producing values for them.
</li>
</ol>
