<p><b>Two Ideas for mini-Hacks</b>

<p> <p>
1. "The Well and the Wall" - My answer to CatB. What I did
with Freecell Solver, how I did it differently, was it a
good thing. Why it worked at the end, and why I'm happy with what I did in general. (note that Freecell Solver is substantially different than fetchmail in several respects). Includes a note about why releasing it under the public domain was the best thing I could ever do with it. (and why I hope Linus would agree with me)

<p> <p>
2. "The Bible Revision 2" - an objectivisitically-corrected version of the Bible. Complete and cute blasphomy. I already have a few scenes in mind.

<p><b>The Solving Blessing</b>

<p>
Inspired a lot by "If"/Rudyard Kipling but what the heck:


<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;
May you have the courage to speak what you think and not what people want you to hear.<br />
May you follow reason instead of emotions<br />
May you admire great men but not on the expense of degrading youself.<br />
May you never see any man, dead or alive as superior to
yourself.<br />
May you take responsibility for your actions and for
your problems.<br />
May you never feel guilty.<br />
May you be a fanatic of freedom, justice and honesty.<br />
May you never be afraid to be called a fanatic.<br />
May you pursue sincerity and honesty with all your heart,
tact taken into account<br />
May you recognize a non-sequitor, diversion, equivocation or other logical or cognitive error, when you see one, don't be afraid to point it out, and become stronger knowing that you spotted it.<br />
May you never follow any dogmas<br />
May you live forever, mind body and soul.<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;

A bit rough on the edges, probably, but usable.

<p><b>BitKeeper</b>

<p>
I posted a comment to bitkeeper-users about the license. I think it was a tactful one. Then I was told License wars are off-topic there. <sigh>

<p>So I suggested they start a separate mailing list for them. ;-).
