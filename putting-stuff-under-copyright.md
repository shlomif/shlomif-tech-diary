First of all IANAL/etc. Anyway, I try to give explicit and more permissive licences (e.g: [https://creativecommons.org/](https://creativecommons.org/) ones) to all my posts and works because otherwise they are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All\_rights\_reserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved) by default and so under a much more restrictive implicit licensing condition. I know that [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashleigh\_Brilliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashleigh_Brilliant) got copyright to apply to relatively short sentences (which this post is longer than them), and that there was a court decision that made it a violation to sample and reuse even a single chord of a copyrighted song.

Better be safe than sorry. Are you a lawyer per chance?
