TheCodexâ„¢ defines a hacker's God, as any-and-every entity that affected their past-or-present or can affect their future. This includs his players, "laws" of physics, his friends/leaders, he himself - even his roleplaying games / stories / screenplays / etc. characters.

Accepting this, I tend to think that God exists given my mind, and my surrounding have a lot of law-and-order. I think I am part of my (and many other hackers) God.

However, on freenode IRC, a friend told me is that God is me and only me. Given my first coherent memories are from israeli 1st grade in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Aviv_Gimel at around 1983 (I was born in 5 May 1977). that implies my mind created numerous beautiful entities (including street cats, Golden Retriever dogs, beautiful ladies)
