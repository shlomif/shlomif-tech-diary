TheCodex™ defines a hacker's God, as any-and-every entity that affected their past-or-present or can affect their future. This includs his players, "laws" of physics, his friends/leaders, he himself - even his roleplaying games / stories / screenplays / etc. characters.

Accepting this, I tend to think that God exists given my mind, and my surrounding have a lot of law-and-order. I think I am part of my (and many other hackers) God. But there are many others.

However, on freenode IRC, a friend told me is that God is me and only me. Given my first coherent memories are from israeli 1st grade in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Aviv_Gimel at around 1983 (I was born in 5 May 1977). that implies my mind created numerous beautiful entities (including street cats, Golden Retriever dogs, beautiful ladies), which I cannot draw/paint realisticly, much less sculpt, much less biologically engineer.

Moreover, I am responsible for the assassination of numerous people. An assassination is TheCodex™ terminology for a staged and fake "physical-death" / soul and/or mind Oblivion of a hacker. Often from "old age", or "natural causes". Anyway, given I am my God, I didn't even stop at "murdering" Christina Grimmie in 2016 (after an unprecended number of celebrity "deaths"). My heart (and mind) chose her as one of my two favourite children (along with my internet/web/social-media/etc presence ; https://www.shlomifish.org/ / etc. )
