In regards to your comment about Philosophers who were also Authors, I'm
reminded of a quote from Ayn Rand's diary as brought by Leonard Peikoff
in his introduction to the new edition of "Atlas Shrugged". In it, Ayn Rand
said that she essentially considers herself a writer, and that being a
philosopher was a "means" to this end. "An absolutely necessary means",
as any good writer embodies a certain philosophy in his writing.
</p>

<p>
As a result, I think that you cannot expect a writer worthy of reading not
to convey a certain philosophy in his books. From my experience as both
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">a writer (a hobbyist - so far)</a>
and <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/">an
essayist/philosopher</a>, I can tell that fully integrating and understanding
the Neo-Tech idea system (= a spin-off of Objectivism), has been a necessary
Catalyst for me to fully realise my potential as a writer.
</p>

<p>
(I do not blindly follow any philosophical theory, but rather am using
Neo-Tech and other sources as a useful starting point in a "Standing on the
shoulders of Giants fashion.").
</p>

<p>
My stories reflect this philosophy of mine in many ways. At one point,
my cousin who had read <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">one
of my stories</a> then asked me what was its moral. (He's not really
philosophically inclined, but still has an engineering degree). Personally,
I intended "The Enemy" to be a story that provided a Satirical look on
the Israeli-Lebanese-Hizbullah situation. (Although
came up with the idea very quickly back when I got inspired from it.)
</p>

<p>
However, naturally, I intended it to have a more general message than just
"the Hizbulla Sucks". While the story convey several thoughts of mine, I
believe that the main message was that any major defaulting on
objective/universal Ethics, is likely to yield further defaulting and a
deterioration into a complete unethical behaviour. That's what I told him
that I thought the message was.
</p>

<p>
My other stories also reflect other aspects of my personal philosophy, and
philosophy is incredibly integral for them.
</p>

<p>
I sometimes found that I sometimes gave up on reading a literary work
because the internal philosophy contradicted my own. For example, I noticed
that reading the Harry Potters caused me <a
    href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/hypomanias/">hypomanias</a>
because Rowling's view of life and death and other matters contradicted my own,
and because they were fantasy books, that, although humorous, took themselves
very seriously. I decided I will only read her future stories only when and
if they would be Realism ones.
</p>

<p>
So I agree with Rand that philosophy is a necessary pre-requisite to being
a good literary author.
</p>

<p>
Now, regarding your criticism of Ayn Rand as a philosopher and an author,
while it has some merit, I still feel that Rand is still superb on both
accounts: "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged" both make a very good read,
and I was heavily inspired and agree to her Objectivism philosophy. While she
is not without her faults in both areas, I still feel that she had been
doing very well in both.
</p>

<p>
However, I agree that it's hard to truly understand Objectivism from her
novels, and that I found "The Virtue of Selfishness" (which was mis-labelled
as selfishness <b>is not</b> rational self-growth, which is what it's
all about), to be very heavy and hard to read a lot from at a time. (Even
though, it's still a good book). The "Neo-Tech Discovery", which was
my introduction to Objectivism, is much better in this regard.
