<p>
Having been introduced to this forum, and having posted a few comments on other
people's posts, I'd like to introduce myself and my philosophical creations.
My name is <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>, and I have
been writing <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">stories</a>
and <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/">essays</a> and published
most of them on my homepage under liberal licences. Both of them convey my
viewpoint and influences as an Objectivist, a software developer, an
amateur mathematician, and someone who is enthusiastic about the
open-source/open-content movements and is an active contributor to them.

I'll be happy if you can take a look at some of the many things I wrote there.
While I have many essays, I believe that my stories also vividly convey my
philosophy. Among the highlights on what you can find there are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/advice-for-the-young/">Advice
        for the Young</a> - there was a trend in the online software
    blogosphere of giving advice to young people a while ago, and I joined
    the fun and gave my own advice.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/">"The
        Case for File Swapping"</a> - here I present and prove the claim that
    non-commercial re-distribution of public copyrighted works should be legal.
    </p>
    <p>
    I later continued this theme in <a
        href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/closed-books-are-so-19th-century/">"Why
        Closed Books are so
        19th-century"</a>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">"The Enemy and How
        I Helped to Fight it"</a> - this was my first story and is still my
    favourite. It is based on the situation in the Israeli-Lebanese border, but
    conveys a much more universal message.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOWTF/">"The One with the
        Fountainhead"</a> - this is an episode of the T.V. show "Friends"
    that parodies the book "The Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand. It is probably
    my funniest piece yet.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/foss-other-beasts/">"Open
        Source, Free Software and Other Beasts"</a> - an article
    introducing the world of "Free and Open Source Software" to people
    who are not familiar with it.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
    <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/">"The
        Eternal Jew"</a> - an article that nicely summarises the
    principles of my view on self and of life. Probably the closest essay
    I've written to pure-Philosophy
    </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
I've also been placing some philosophical thoughts and insights, which I did
find mature or large-scope enough for a dedicated essay on my homepage,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/blogs/">on my blogs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I'd be happy to hear what you think about the stuff I wrote.
