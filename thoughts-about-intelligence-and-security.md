Thoughts about intelligence and security.

First of all, it is commonly believed that an organisation should reveal as little as possible about what they know and plan. Like Joel Spolsky noted in [Mouth Wide Shut](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/MouthWideShut.html), when it comes to business. This is echoed in the [motto of Katarina from League of Legends](https://imgur.com/gallery/JN2ybKX) (photo is a bit NSFW) of «Keep your friends close, and your enemies guessing».

We may feel frustrated that the U.S. government will “neither confirm nor deny” any ridiculous claim including lizard people controlling the government, U.F.O. landings, or known demonic activity, but they will likely neither confirm or deny more rational claims such as [terrorist training in Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi Regime](http://shlomif.livejournal.com/tag/iraq) because if you start confirming or denying random things, it may panic people.

Another conclusion I reached is that when protecting intelligence data or intelligence information, the important objective is not to hide a particular item of them from someone who really really really (!) wants to know it, because they will likely know it anyway. The main objective is that at any time, one should keep most of the important intelligence information from the prying eyes of the general public, where it may cause panic or truly be abused.

In the film [Mission: Impossible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_%28film%29),
the protagonists go to great lengths to steal the file containing the identities
of all CIA agents and then to protect it. However, I think that in this day
and age the identities of most agents, whether of the CIA or otherwise,
is public knowledge (available on the darknet/etc.) and they are simply secure
by the fact that no one in particular will wish or dare to harm them.

I met a young woman in a local daily assembly of dogs and their owners, who
told me she works for [the Mossad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad),
and said she cannot tell me what she does there (and I did not try to
push her towards revealing what she did there). Point is that she could admit
it instead of the traditional thinking that Mossad workers cannot reveal
their identity.

Another thing that should be understood is: 1. That there’s a lot of “Intel”
(= Intelligence data/information) out there. 2. That a lot of it is out-of-date
, or even - false. 3. The hard thing is to get the global picture.
