Thoughts about intelligence and security.

First of all, it is commonly believed that an organisation should reveal as little as possible about what they know and plan. Like Joel Spolsky noted in [Mouth Wide Shut](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/MouthWideShut.html), when it comes to business. This is echoed in the [motto of Katarina from Leauge of Legends](https://imgur.com/gallery/JN2ybKX) (photo is a bit NSFW) of «Keep your friends close, and your enemies guessing».

We may feel frustrated that the U.S. government will "neither confirm nor deny" any ridiculous claim including lizard people controlling the government, U.F.O. landings, or known demonic activity, but they will likely neither confirm or deny more rational claims such as [terrorist training in Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi Regime](http://shlomif.livejournal.com/tag/iraq) because if you start confirming or denying random things, it may panic people.

Another conclusion I reached is that when protecting intelligence data or intelligence information, the important objective is not to hide a particular item of them from someone who really really really (!) wants to know it, because they will likely know it anyway. The main objective is that at any time, one should keep most of the important intelligence information from the prying eyes of the general public, where it may cause panic or truly be abused.
