Thanks for the video - I enjoyed it though it may be said tongue-in-cheak. That put aside, I have written some advice to the victims of this leak here - http://www.reddit.com/r/JenniferLawrence/comments/2fjgeq/advice_to_jennifer_about_the_recent_photos_leak/ ( short URL: http://redd.it/2fjgeq ).

I would feel my privacy is violated if any of my non-public files (e.g: private E-mails including those that are not too sexualised) were made public by someone who wasn't the recipient or the sender. However, once that happened, the best is to accept it and move on because trying to get them off the Net is futile.

Another point I make there is that any sexual or sexualised behaviour, including starring in a hardcore pornographic film, or selling sexual services for money (= prostitution) is neither wrong nor disrespectful.
