The [Call for Action for "Finishing Off the Open Content / Web 2.0 Revolution"](http://shlomifish.livejournal.com/3001.html) was issued today and directed at the people who were [cast](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/cast.html) or associated with the screenplay [Summerschool at the NSA](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/), but also at each and any independent or professional film maker and [hacker (a.k.a an action hero)](http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/david_and_goliath.html) who can contribute to producing and directing versions and variations of it.

This screenplay was written over a year ago (some months before the Snowden revelations fiasco broke out), and in it two Hollywood actresses — Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Summer Glau (Firefly, the Sarah Connor Chronicles, xkcd, etc.) — conspire to kick the ass of the American [National Security Agency ("NSA")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency) in a completely non-violent and non-destructive manner while making everyone happier. This screenplay materialised an [old meme](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=smg-next-film) from 1997 and a life time of study and preparation.

The implications of producing this film is that my reign as the [hacker king](http://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/gyrcAfAASev) of the Open Content / Web 2.0 revolution (~2000-2014) will finally come to an end and thus concluding the open content revolution with a blazing success. Furthermore, I hope to pass the baton of hacker monarch to Summer Glau, one of my [“Galateas”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatea_%28mythology%29) who became an "apple that completely supplanted the tree" and who appears to want to be a hacker monarch, more badly than I do, and it will be ultimately up to her to lead the next revolution of technology (both tangible, but equally as important - mental).

If you think that all of this, while seeming farfetched sounds really cool, then share it on social media sites (consider using the "#SummerNSA" hash tag and also see http://facebook.com/SummerNSA ) and consider helping to produce or direct a film out of this.

There are several goals that I'm trying to achieve with all this:

1. Giving legitamacy to my new format of screenplays, which one it compiles can be checked into source control and used as is, instead of as the Hollywood blessed format that is extremely hard to get right.

2. Give legitimacy to independent fan fiction, crossovers, Real Person Fiction, remakes, and reboots, some of which have been looked down upon due to 20th century obsession with "originality", "professionalism" and "keeping a technical advantage to yourself" instead of sharing.

3. Finally merge the worlds of the computer industry (including the open source, web and Internet workers) , the content industry and enthusiasts (including Hollywood, the RIAA, MPAA, YouTube/etc. artists, etc.) and the Academia.

4. Prove to the world that there is a case for "amateurism"/"geekery" (= enjoying what you do or doing it for fun) and that geeks can compete and even surpass professionals.

5. Prove that it is possible to make money, and/or build esteem, recognition and fame from artwork that is under non-"all rights reserved" licences such as the [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons) licences.
