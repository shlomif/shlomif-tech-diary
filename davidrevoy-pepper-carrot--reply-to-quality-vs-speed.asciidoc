Thanks, David for the reply! I may have been wrong (as "all truth is God's truth" and "truth is a function of time"): https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1351069373952360448 . Also one can never please everyone ( http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Never_Try_to_Please_Everyone/ ). I also admit I have voiced opinions or advice that I take back now (or were not serious).

Furthermore, like I note in

, due to the aesthetics-seeking nature of humans,
quicker-and-less-quality-techs do not always completely replace the slower-and-better-quality-ones.
E.g: some religious manuscripts are still written by scribes by hand because their
quality must be very high.

A different suggestion from me is that you include the "midrash" (= "study") of each strip on its page, as a teaser for visiting the forum thread. See, e.g the ones in my image macros page:
