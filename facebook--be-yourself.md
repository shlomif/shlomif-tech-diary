"Be yourself" online and offline. If you are an "altright" parody blogger give a fat warning saying what you really think. You can mark april fools jokes as such: https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/28_Pranks_Later . It's ok to praise Darth Vader https://www.geekwire.com/2011/top-10-reasons-darth-vader-amazing-project-manager/ and even Adolf Hitler/etc have things going for them. A female software developer I know complained on https://twitter.com/nslater/status/545592700289155072 that "wizards, ninjas, and rockstars" were a masculine thing while today it is not unthinkable to call female devs that.

On the flip side, I had good reasons for introducing male slayers, witches ("warlocks")/etc. to my Buffy fanfic at https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/ and I think it worked out.

I am not ashamed of admitting that while I'm ok with gay, lesbian and bisexual (and straight) people, I think transsexualism is a silly trend due to not "being yourself" and sex change operations are a health risk. I will still talk with you if you are such, and not bother you or nag you deliberately too much. If you wish to block me from sub-forums due to that opinion, be my guest! just note that I am being honest and you're essentially burning people: http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/

Some people claimed I "molest" the fictional characters in my stories&aphorisms ( https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/ ) and they can think that, but others enjoy them and/or find them insightful. And frankly a lot of fanfic/crossovers (and the Jewish Tanakh) are much more graphical and appalling. Taylor Swift depicted her and her friends laying waste to a whole city in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood_(Taylor_Swift_song) but I strongly suspect that in real life she (or Chuck Norris or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger for that matter) will never deliberately kick a friendly cat or dog.

Please don't hold people or collectives liable for their past opinions, past writings, past actions, etc. They can and have changed (see https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse#Dispelling_in_the_Selinaverse ).

You can think that liking My Little Pony makes a man even girlier than a gay man, but I am now thinking that most of the best male or female (and usually straight) melee and missile warriors today and always had a sensitive, compassionate and merciful side: https://twitter.com/search?q=%40shlomif%20gilmore%20girls&src=typed_query .

I think https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie could have been alive today if she kept her hair in its beautiful natural black colour, did more collabs with fellow youtubers (including some very obscure ones), embraced her destiny as a contender for a new "hacker/action-hero queen regent" (or "messiah": https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacker-monarchs.xhtml ), and do it in her own geeky, quirky, but awesome way.

When Taylor Swift released the song with a video with homoerotic elements, I commented that I disliked it, and many likeminded geeks (see: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/paul-graham.html for "amateurs") commented the same that she rebounded.
