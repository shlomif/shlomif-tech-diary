A very merry unbirthday to all! Because during every day you mature by a year (While hopefully remaining young-at-heart and non-cynical).

Here is what I want for my unbirthday. I can buy my own tangible goods when and if i need them, but I want temporal gifts: a walk in the neigbhourhood, a breakfast, lunch, or supper in a nice restaurant or caf√©, a chit-chat, a private lesson request (Which I'll give for the right price), an invitation to give a talk, a trip to a different city or the wilderness, or even a trip abroad. And maybe just a pleasant chat on the Internet.

Now, my birthday according to the Gregorian calendar is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_5 - 5 of May - and it's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinco_de_Mayo and lots of other stuff - but it's OK for you to forget it or miss it. But please don't miss all the rest of the days of the year that are my unbirthdays, because it's important to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem and give the people you like and love a good time.

I realised by an accidental visit to http://www.reddit.com/r/SummerGlau that I missed her birthday - 24 of July. I also found out that according to the Hebrew calendar she was born on the Saturday (= the Sabbath in Judaism) before the upcoming https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av despite some prophecies that the Messiah will be born on Nine of Av. So Nine of Av is   the unbirthday of Ms. Glau (who is now the most awesome person in the whole world - https://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/gyrcAfAASev ) according to the Hebrew calendar. And it's a time to celebrate.

Good sons of Israel of the world, there is no need to fast in Nine of Av! The third temple has been set in Jerusalem but not on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriah but on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_University_of_Jerusalem (Har Hatsofim). And that's not all, but the real Temple is no longer in Jerusalem, whose air feels holy like a thing of the past which you no longer belong there, but in the many Alexandrias of the world: http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#new_alexandrias - cities of a lot of commerce, interaction, action, immigration, industry, creativity, fun, sin and even crime - where values are produced a lot and there's a lot of life. They are usually port towns but not always - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin for instance - and it naturally includes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv and vicinty, which is the It city of Israel and the place where this message is being written from.

So rejuice because the new #TempleOfIsrael ,and life and liberty and happiness and the celebration of human material but equally important - mental technology is here. Mark my words as the Little Red Riding Hood of #Messiahs! A very merry birthday or unbirthday to all geeks/amateurs (= people who love what they do), #hackers (= people who bend the rules; action heroes - see http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath ; people who are both confident and know to be sloppy with things that don't matter too much - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYX8sjIzjGw ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy5fm4gxq-s ) and good hard-working people of the world of all ethnicities and proclaimed beliefs, and that includes the poster girl of the anti-geek - Penny from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory - who is a wonderful and superb geek and hacker.

Let's eat as much or as little as we want, drink a lot of water and/or other beverages, enjoy the good company of birthday laurets or unbirthday laurets, and have a lot of clean, creative and productive fun. It's party time!

Happy Tisha Be'av everyone and have a happy birthday/unbirthday!
