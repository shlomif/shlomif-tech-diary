# Debian:  requesting help with uploading packages

Hi all,

first of all note that I've been enjoying using Debian (Bookworm now) as
my main desktop OS: it is stable, and functional.

Anyway, this intent-to-package of rinutils: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=993764
received no review or was submitted.
