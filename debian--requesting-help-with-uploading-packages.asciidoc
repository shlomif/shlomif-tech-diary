# Debian:  requesting help with uploading packages

Hi all,

first of all note that I've been enjoying using Debian (Bookworm now) as
my main desktop OS: it is stable, and functional.

Anyway, this intent-to-package of rinutils: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=993764
(also see the build-in-docker script at https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod/blob/master/scripts/debian-packaging/build-rinutils-debian-package--using-docker.pl )
received no review or was submitted. An email I sent on 14 September to https://github.com/xtaran was not answered.

rinutils is a build-time dep of https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=freecell-solver
and https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=fortune-mod and other packages I
am upstream for. Their current debian packages are out-of-date, and contain
known bugs including crashes.
