# Debian:  requesting help with uploading packages

Hi all,

first of all note that I've been enjoying using Debian (Bookworm now) as
my main desktop OS: it is stable, and functional.

Anyway, this intent-to-package of rinutils: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=993764
(also see the build-in-docker script at https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod/blob/master/scripts/debian-packaging/build-rinutils-debian-package--using-docker.pl )
received no review or was submitted. An email I sent on 14 September to https://github.com/xtaran was not answered.

rinutils is a build-time dep of https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=freecell-solver
and https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=fortune-mod and other packages I
am the upstream for. Their current debian packages are out-of-date, and contain
known bugs including crashes.

Another bug report that fell between the cracks is
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=992996 :

Subject: dbtoepub creates temporary directories unsecurely and unreliably
Date: Thu, 26 Aug 2021 08:53:47 +0300

Package: dbtoepub
Version: 0+svn9904-4

Hi all! This security/reliability patch is not present in Debian
stable's dbtoepub:

https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets/commit/10c1f2e3a565c4799ec1106784c76f6cd7f2f2ea

As a result, my home site's `*.epub`s have been building unreliably.

Can these reports be given the sufficient attention, and the issue-handling process be improved into the future? I believe the bottleneck is not me. From my experience in contributing to Fedora (see https://pagure.io/user/shlomif[my user page] ), getting packages reviewed and accepted and uploading new versions was a far quicker process.
