I am seeking a recommendation for a yoga instructor for me (1977-born; male; [openly bipolar](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/why-openly-bipolar-people-should-not-be-medicated/) with a history of consumption of prescription psychiatric drugs with side effects; [otherwise "clean"](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/diet.xhtml); lives in Ramat Aviv Gimel, Tel Aviv) or an Internet forum to ask for one.

I am willing to pay them up to 300 ILS/hour (including commute time and compensation for missed / cancelled sessions).

The reason I wish to try yoga is in order to try to remedy hands and fingers fatigue and paralysis, as well as mouth paralysis and general weakness. They are all suspected to be caused by the prolonged consumption of the psychiatric drugs (since ~1997-1998).
