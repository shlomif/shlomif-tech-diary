I am seeking a recommendation for a yoga instructor for me (1977-born; male; [openly bipolar](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/why-openly-bipolar-people-should-not-be-medicated/) with a history of consumption of prescription psychiatric drugs with side effects; [otherwise "clean"](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/diet.xhtml); lives in Ramat Aviv Gimel, Tel Aviv) or an Internet forum to ask for one.

I am willing to pay them up to 300 ILS/hour (including commute time and compensation for missed / cancelled sessions).
