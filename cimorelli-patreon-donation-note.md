Hi!

First of all note that I am donating the money to you folks out of appreciation for the joy and inspiration you have given me (and the world at large). I don't expect anything immediate in return (just realise that sharing and voluntarily giving pays back in spades), but I request that you take my suggestions into consideration.

I hope I'm not being considered too domineering and meddling in other people's
affairs, but:

1. I encourage people to encourage others to criticise them ( http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/ ).

2. This is part of my "job" (= responsibility) as a "Messiah" / a "hacker monarch" / a "Pope" which is a role that I also encourage every man or woman, of any age to take: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gamedev--make-everyone--messiahs ; https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/ .

3. I care about the well being and happiness of everyone in the world.

I may be wrong, but request that you ponder my advice ( https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if--- ).

Anyway, judging by the video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8Z3xhR_QE4 ) it seems that Dani as well as the 5 other singers are unhappy - and even saddened by her decision to leave. They cite the fact that being part of the band is too time consuming and interferes with her passion in Graphics design. But I think it does not absolutely needs to be so.

Like the David vs. Goliath story shows ( https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional ), one needs to "hack", bend the rules/guidelines, be resourceful, defy one's "fate", find creative solutions, and use technology: both tangible, but also intellectual one.

E.g: If Dani would rather not go on tours, she can be filmed, recorded and be displayed from the comfort of her home. Or if there are too many covers that you are interested in producing, then either pick up ones based on auctions ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJrqpR_7VSo ) or roll dice. Or Dani may be absent from some recordings and live shows. And so forth and so on.

As a fellow creator I can attest that I am often overflowing with many ideas for new stuff to write or older stuff to improve. But I try to prioritise the most important (or most fun) tasks first. Note however that I market myself as a writer, humorist, software developer, and unskillful graphics and video editor rather than as a musician. (I have some recordings of songs on my YouTube channel, but I admit many of them are even worse than most of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Sings 's stuff.)

Dani was one of my favourites singers in part due to her playfulness, the fact that she had sang off key in some early videos, and she being a lean and mean rapper. So I'd hate to see her permanently leave (and don't want her to needlessly be unhappy).

Do note that I'd also appreciate some social media publicity for my web site (  https://www.shlomifish.org/ ; https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/ ) and my other social media outlets ( https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/ ) and my latest (CC-BY-licensed) attempt to continue revolutionize the film/drama/fiction/gaming industry: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/ .

As I believe I to have identified there, most talented, skillful, competent, and attractive individuals of any gender, age, beliefs, qualities or professions, or past experience are increasingly both geeks (= "amateur"; love what they do) and hackers (= "action heroes"; bending or challenging the "rules", not accepting their fate, etc.).

This means most new quality screenplays / stories are and will increasingly not only be fanfiction but also crossovers, parodies, and/or real person fiction - usually including recent "proprietary" franchises and recent (and often living) real people.

And they also will not be written in the Hollywood-blessed format, which takes a long time to prepare, is boring, and cannot be easily validated and "linted" ( https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters ) by automated software tools. It is pointless to require such a finicky format because screenplays are being mutated (or "hacked") during all of the production's stages.

Moreover, attractive actors (including female and/or inexperienced and obscure ones) are also geeky hackers and will not play in any badly written film (and usually dystopian, ending badly, pessimistic, politically correct and dishonest) even for all the money in the world.

The proprietary and anti-geeky nature of late 19th century - 20th-century
copyright was acceptable and tolerated by Sarah Bernhardt (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt ; the first "alpha female" of
worldwide stage and screen I can trace my way to, and likely a superb geek and
hacker) back around 1900 and worked fairly well up to roughly the 1990s.
However, it is no longer acceptable today by actors and screenwriters of any
age and past experience. Moreover, Cookie Monster disapproves of it as well:

Anyway, if you want to read some more bite-sized writings, I also have some factoids ( https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/ - some about Chuck Norris, but also about some fictional or even real life females, as well as inanimate things) and quotations/aphorisms ( https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/aphorisms/ ).

It is up to you to do what you want to help me, and I'd be happy to hear any criticism of my works.

Stay cool, be strong, become stronger, keep the faith, "never give up", you're awesome, "go out there, believe in the ball, and throw yourself" (and I believe in you!), "may the Schwartz be with you.", "the Schwartz is in you.", etc. etc. ( However, don't be irrationally stubborn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FCld2UJMRg - "You need to know when to walk away." )
