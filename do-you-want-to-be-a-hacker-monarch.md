"Who the hell are the Qohelethes?" or in plainer English "Who are the
hacker monarchs of the world?"

What is a Hacker Monarch?  A Hacker Monarch is also known as
a “Warrior King/Queen/Monarch” / The best-of-the-best-of-the-best /
A Saladin / A Qoheleth / A John Galt / A King Messiah / A master vampire
/ etc. To quote what Quark from the Star Trek franchise said about the Grand Nagus, he/she: «has the greatest business mind… always thinking ten, sometimes twenty steps ahead of everyone else.» and the kind of person who has the same ideas as everyone else only five years earlier and thus is named a lunatic.

Up to a few days ago, it was believed that only a selected group of few people can be Hacker monarchs for a time. My tenative list of the
known *The* Hacker monarchs is, since Saladin who was the first exemplar
The Hacker Monarch:

Saladin, Leonardo da-Vinci, Isaac Newton, Cardinal Richelieu, George Washington, Alexandre Dumas Pere, Jules Verne, Walt Disney, Ayn Rand, The Beatles, Jim Henson, Samantha Smith, Larry Wall, the fictional Capt. Jean-Luc Picard from "Star Trek: TNG", the fictional Buffy Summers from the show "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", Shlomi Fish (= me), and finally - Summer Glau ( http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/ )

What happened with Summer Glau? As you know, she is a terminator, and as
terminators go she “terminated” the whole obsession with the “The” in **The**
Hacker Monarch and opened the role of **A** Hacker monarch up for grabs.

So the current known Hacker Monarchs are:

* Summer Glau

* Shlomi Fish (= me)

Some potential people who can immediately become hacker monarchs by virtue
of association with the hacker monarchs emeriti:

* Larry Wall

* Sarah Michelle Gellar

* Joss Whedon

* Patrick Stewart

* Frank Oz - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Oz

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Peikoff

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe

But we could use more of them.

How do I become a hacker? A hacker, or an action hero, is someone who, like
the myth of David vs. Goliath illustrates - http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/david_and_goliath.html , does not accept his fate, and bends or
even breaks the rules to earn his victory. This is while a tragic hero is
bound by many invisible or even written rules, and accepts his fate, which
is almost certainly death, stagnation and destruction.

To further understand the point, see:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anEuw8F8cpE - modernisation of David vs.
Goliath from the the first Indiana Jones film.

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z9Ismh1elM - The trailer for Hamlet starring
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

And just for the record, even http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Penny from
The Big Bang Theory, the contemporary archtypical “anti-geeky” “dumb blonde”,
is a wonderful and superb hacker and action heroine, as was
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Clueless_characters#Cher_Horowitz before
her.

While it’s up to a person to choose whether to be a hacker or not, the
alternative of it is being a tragic hero, which means to become cynical and
miserable and to slowly stagnate and die, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
