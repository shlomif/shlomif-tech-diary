<p>
I've started blogging on <a href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a>.
(Here's <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/shlomif/diary.html?start=0">my
first entry</a>). However, starting a year or two ago, I've been cross-posting
my entries to LiveJournal as well, and I also found it has some other
advantages. Lately, I've been having second thoughts about whether to continue
doing this. Here are some of my reasons:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Advogato is full of spam. I've been <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/shlomif/#certs">certified as Master</a> by a bootload of spammers. And because
Advogato does not have a rel="nofollow" attribute to external links, and other
spam protection, we cannot expect this spam to stop soon.
</li>
<li>
Advogato has no comments for blog entries. Instead, people comment to what
other people say in their blogs by writing new blog entries. However, I don't
read them, and they are also not associated with the articles in any way
(except perhaps by a back-links search). This is not good. On LiveJournal,
I have comments, which people can use to write their entries for me.
</li>
<li>
The HTML support of Advogato is very incomplete. Moreover, it tends to mangle
my XHTML into strange HTML.
</li>
<li>
My blog has received a low interest ratings. Such ratings simply don't exist
on LiveJournal, nor shouldn't - they are anti-social. Most Advogato'ers
probably don't bother rating other people's blogs.
</li>
<li>
Some resources in Advogato are not easily discoverable by the web interface.
</li>
<li>
Most of my friends moved their blogs elsewhere, anyway.
</li>
<li>
Advogato discourages short, timeful entries. If two mostly consecutive entries
are published, one of them will be lost. This encourages me to publish
monolithic entries on several different topics, instead of small short
entries.
</li>
<li>
Abandoning Advogato will allow my LiveJournal blog to be syndicated in the
Ãœber-cool <a href="http://advogato.ev-en.org/">Planet (Former) Advogato</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Obviously discontinuing publishing my blog at Advogato has some disadvantages
like not being in the Advogato recent log, etc. but I think the advantages
outweigh them.
</p>

<p>
So unless someone changes my mind, I guess it's goodbye from Advogato.
