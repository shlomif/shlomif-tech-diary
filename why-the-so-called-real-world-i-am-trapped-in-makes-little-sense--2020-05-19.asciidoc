Here are some reasons the outside world as I perceive it makes little sense:

https://www.explainxkcd.com/[xkcd] had some RPF (e.g: https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/406:_Venting ), and my https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ was well-received on https://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/[/r/xkcd] and elsewhere. Nevertheless, later on I was told "RPF? Never do that!" on an xkcd IRC chatroom and was promptly banned.

It is not clear whether bigger muscles imply that a person is physically stronger or not.

https://twitter.com/TheRealGrimmie[Christina Grimmie] was reportedly killed after several years of not doing stuff her way.

I am a feeble and frail man who is otherwise of strong spirit, and who is attracted to strong girls, especially physically strong and/or muscular ones: https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1394689324554334210 .

I "pirate" (= copy, share, and build upon) copyrighted works all over the place ("ARRRRRRRR!!!").
