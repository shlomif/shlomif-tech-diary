Here are some reasons the outside world as I perceive it makes little sense:

https://www.explainxkcd.com/[xkcd] had some RPF (e.g: https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/406:_Venting ), and my https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ was well-received on https://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/[/r/xkcd] and elsewhere. Nevertheless, later on I was told "RPF? Never do that!" on an xkcd IRC chatroom and was promptly banned.

It is not clear whether bigger muscles imply that a person is physically stronger or not.
