Here are some reasons the outside world as I perceive it makes little sense:

We seem to be dealing with epistemological demons.

https://www.explainxkcd.com/[xkcd] had some RPF (= https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/["Real Person Fiction"], e.g: https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/406:_Venting ), and my https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ was well-received on https://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/[/r/xkcd] and elsewhere. Nevertheless, later on I was told "RPF? Never do that!" on an xkcd IRC chatroom, and was promptly banned.

It is not clear whether bigger muscles imply that a person is physically stronger or not.

https://twitter.com/TheRealGrimmie[Christina Grimmie] was reportedly killed after several years of not doing stuff her way.

I am a feeble and frail man who is otherwise of strong spirit, and who is attracted to strong girls, especially physically strong and/or muscular ones: https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1394689324554334210 .

I "pirate" (= copy, share, and build upon) copyrighted works all over the place ("ARRRRRRRR!!!").

I think that commercial fan fiction not only will be ethical, but is necessary: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/

"Science" is often a device to enforce external authority and "truisms" and "facts". Just like religions, if not worse: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/learning_more_from_inet_forums.xhtml .

I think "mass production" (more like "mass duplication") has been done using Extraterrestial technology (called e.g https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Q_Continuum_%28Selinaverse%29[The Q Continuum] ) given large factories, farms, and trucks/etc. make everyone who work there miserable.

I think there has been a conspiracy of the demons inside me to try to convince me that the world outside me was getting worse, and that I was more and more isolated, friendless and unpopular. Well, game over - I won - you shall lose!

There are thousands' years old hackers (aka "vampires") and below-20 ones who are huge fans of one another: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/kai-blanche.xhtml .

It is possible yada` (= "to know" in Hebrew) meant "to educate / to entertain" and involves pleasure, but sometimes pain too, and was mutual, and always spawns ( possibly invisible ) baby angels. If it makes you bored or indifferent, it likely is not effective. https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/

I had a very short haircut for many years now and given girls have many "bad hair days" (re https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Harry-Potter-indiv-nodes/the_beautiful_assistant.xhtml and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N2k-gv6xNE ) think they may wish to follow suit: https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10365754/emma-watson-bob-haircut-2021

Per https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1173621519274127361 "I love the film Labyrinth. it was so funky and nice and David Bowie was great and Jennifer Connely was so touching and maybe could have taken the oscar if there was no prejudice against her youth and the fact it wasa fantasy/children film back then.": Jennifer Connely likely was nominated and won (and it may not have been an age record).

â‡’ Emma Watson may have won the Oscar for some of the Harry Potters: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/bad_acting_emma_watson.xhtml

Terran science, which was an epistemological facade (Faster-than-light travel, duplication of galaxies), turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because many Terran scientists and engineers and developers were highly concerned about efficiency and reliability.

I exhibit a Descarteseque https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon - like situation. The demon contorts my perception of the outside world, but I still have logic and older memories.

As a child, I wanted to be good-hearted (= noble, honest, benevolent) and later on aspired to be world savior / messiah / "the greatest person in history". I guess "nice guys finish last".
