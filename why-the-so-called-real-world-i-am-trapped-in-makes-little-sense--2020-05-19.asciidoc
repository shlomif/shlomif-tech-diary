Here are some reasons the outside world as I perceive it makes little sense:

The epistemological demons:
---------------------------

We seem to be dealing with epistemological demons.

I exhibit a Descarteseque https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon[Evil demon] - like situation. The demon contorts my perception of the outside world, and may input false emotions and the occasional false thought, but I still have my centre-of-consciousness (aka "the soul", or "the ego"), logic, reason, and older memories.

I believed reality is what was told it must be (by decree of "Science" or "common sense") rather than what I *wanted* it to be ( re xref:#selinaverse_vision[The Selinaverse vision] ). As a result, the demon increasingly tried to convince me the world was getting worse, and that I was increasingly ignored, isolated, and unpopular.

But I now know it isn't and cannot be so. Fuck you, Fear, whoever you may be! I want the world and the multiverse as I want them!

I do not wish to http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Self-Sufficiency/[obey this silly non-reality of yours any more]. I'm going to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Mc-NYPHaQ[break free] and will take all the people I've known with me.

Prior art for my situation:

* https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/#sources_of_inspiration - Selina gets sucked into slaying vampires
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_%281986_film%29[Labyrinth] - Sarah deals with the Goblins.

* http://www.earthstar.co.uk/deep3.htm[H2G2's Planet Earth as a Computer] - «"I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after me," intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones. "A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate - and yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten-million-year program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be called ... The Earth."»

More thoughts:
--------------

https://www.explainxkcd.com/[xkcd] had some RPF (= https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/["Real Person Fiction"], e.g: https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/406:_Venting ), and my https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ was well-received on https://www.reddit.com/r/xkcd/[/r/xkcd] and elsewhere. Nevertheless, later on I was told "RPF? Never do that!" on an xkcd IRC chatroom, and was promptly banned.

It is not clear whether bigger muscles imply that a person is physically stronger or not.

https://twitter.com/TheRealGrimmie[Christina Grimmie] was reportedly killed after several years of not doing stuff her way.

I am a feeble and frail man who is otherwise of strong spirit, and who is attracted to strong girls, especially physically strong and/or muscular ones: https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1394689324554334210 .

I "pirate" (= copy, share, and build upon) copyrighted works all over the place ("ARRRRRRRR!!!"). I've been told https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/fighting_against_the_world.xhtml[it is bad and even "unethical"] or that FOSS / open content / free music / commercial fanfic will "never happen".

I think that commercial fan fiction not only will be ethical, but is necessary: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/

"Science" is often a device to enforce external authority and "truisms" and "facts". Just like religions, if not worse: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/guidelines_as_dogma.xhtml .

People online are often getting hurt over pettier things, instead of http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/[encouraging criticism].

I think "mass production" (more like "mass duplication") has been done using Extraterrestial technology (called e.g https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Q_Continuum_%28Selinaverse%29[The Q Continuum] ) given large factories, farms, and trucks/etc. make everyone who work there miserable (and are often biological hazards).

⇒ The Q Continuum can duplicate or conjure energy, precious minerals, raw materials, inanimate products, foods and drinks, organisms (e.g: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-sharp-programming-life-according-to-valentine[Life According to Valentine] and https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Riker[Thomas Riker]), or even entire galaxies.

⇒ The media keeps saying that there'll be shortages of certain products, but it doesn't happen.

I think there has been a conspiracy of the demons inside me to try to convince me that the world outside me was getting worse, and that I was more and more isolated, friendless and unpopular. Well, game over - I won - you will lose!

There are thousands' years old hackers (aka "vampires") and below-20 ones who are huge fans of one another: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/kai-blanche.xhtml .

[id="biblical_to_know"]
It is possible yada` (= "to know" in Hebrew) meant "to educate / to entertain" and involves pleasure, but sometimes pain too, and was mutual, and always spawns ( possibly invisible ) baby angels. If it makes you bored or indifferent, it likely is not effective. https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/

I had a very short haircut for many years now and given girls have many "bad hair days" (re https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Harry-Potter-indiv-nodes/the_beautiful_assistant.xhtml and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N2k-gv6xNE ) think they may wish to follow suit: https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10365754/emma-watson-bob-haircut-2021

Per https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1173621519274127361 "I love the film Labyrinth. it was so funky and nice and David Bowie was great and Jennifer Connelly was so touching and maybe could have taken the Oscar if there was no prejudice against her youth and the fact it was a fantasy/children film back then.": Jennifer Connelly likely was nominated and won (and it may not have been an age record).

⇒ Emma Watson may have won the Oscar for some of the Harry Potter films: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/bad_acting_emma_watson.xhtml

⇒ Arnold Schwarzenegger likely won it as well: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/bad_acting_ftw.xhtml

Terran science was an epistemological facade (Faster-than-light travel, duplication of galaxies, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records are all possible). However it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because many Terran scientists and engineers and developers were highly concerned about efficiency and reliability and other kinds of https://github.com/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage/blob/master/lib/notes/quality-software--followup-2018.md[quality]. See e.g. http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Is-Microsoft-running-out-of-steam-1102654.html[the variations on the James Watt's steam engine].

⇒ Extraterrestrial technology, although advanced (but naturally not https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#we_all_have_a_master[omnipotent]) was incredibly wasteful. As a result, Earth became a hub for technology - both tangible and intellectual and lately digital as well.

As a child, I wanted to be good-hearted (= noble, honest, benevolent) and later on aspired to be world savior / messiah / "the greatest person in history". I guess "nice guys finish last".

It is not clear why we have to suffer from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism[Consumerism] of large electrical appliances (e.g: washing machines and refrigerators) when they **can** be made more reliable.

I have a very low number of Twitter followers (below 650 - https://twitter.com/shlomif ) and my reddit posts are usually not upvoted a lot ( https://www.reddit.com/user/shlomif ) . This is despite some of my older posts being a staple on Slashdot and other sites (e.g: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Mastering-Cat/["Mastering cat" Interview].)

I lost contact with many online friends due to discontinues of IM services and me not receiving their email/etc replies. The devils are clouding my perception of the world using https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1395025361138761729[my media].

Most people I see on the streets in my neighbourhood, are clearly zombies.

We went from killing women to raping them to sexual harrassment.
Some say one cannot even compliment a woman for her looks.

The other day I was talking with a friend about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling[JK Rowling] as a role model and the following day she said JKR was evil since she opposed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender[Transgender] people (which I do too).

⇒ The same thing happened with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon[Joss_Whedon]'s alleged "sexual harassment" claims. ( also see https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buffy_studies&oldid=1022301852[Buffy studies] ).

People are opposed to the fact that sexual attractiveness strongly correlates with competence:

[id="improve_freenode"]
How Freenode Should Improve?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://freenode.net/[freenode] has a relatively small number of users. Many are anti-geek / anti-hackers ( see https://is.gd/A7rkAh[a definition of "geeks" and "hacking"] ) who have unhappy jobs, paranoid about "privacy", are bound by many "rules", and produce little of true value. Where are the truly great, competent, and sexy, creators?

Maybe https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Taylor-Swift/[Taylor Swift] would be too much to ask. (but I still can hope) But https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Larry-Wall/[lwall / "TimToady"] left, and before that was only active on #perl6/#raku which is a cursed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect project. http://www.catb.org/esr/[esr] seems like a shadow of his former self.

Freenode's "channel independence" is a https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#big-minded-vs-small-minded["Rosh qatan" / "I just work here"] copout. When Cain said https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel["am I my brother's keeper?"] (after freaking killing him out of jealousy!) he meant that he'd let the whole world go to hell rather than care! Morover, such careless attitude tends to result in more and more complaints in the long run.

[id="selinaverse_vision"]
The Selinaverse Vision
----------------------

https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse[The Selinaverse] is a starting point for the multiverse as I (= https://www.shlomifish.org/[Shlomi Fish] ) want it to be, not as what I was told it must be. Namely:

* There is no shortage of electrical/etc. energy, raw materials, tangible products.
* One can be as fat or as thin as they wish while eating as much as they want.
* One can look as young or as old as they want: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/meet-Q-Gadol.xhtml
* There is a shortage of https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/money_cant_buy_you_love.xhtml[sentient beings' "love"] - education and entertainment and conception of new values (whether tangible or spiritual). Akin to the Biblical verb xref:#biblical_to_know[to know].
* Organisms can and will live indefinitely - soul, mind and body.
* Even "poor"er people have homes, and enough to eat.
** They often eventually relocate to a different planet or a different universe (not unlike https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliders[Sliders])
* One can open a portal to a different location on Earth or the multiverse.
* Menial / drudgerous works are done by robots.
* https://is.gd/A7rkAh[Geeky Hackers] are the attractive, competent, cool kids. Even non-perfect-looking men and women can be alphas.
* Earth has no environmental problems.
** There is no ethical problem with eating meat, dairy, eggs, honey, etc. because they are duplicated using https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Q_Continuum_(Selinaverse)[Q Continuum] technology.
* There is https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/hydrogen-bombs-are-likely-an-old-intelligence-hoax.asciidoc[no risk of a nuclear winter]
* Copyright, Patents, and trademarks cannot be used for censoring works.
** Goods are evaluated and sold based on brand, marketing, and development time.
* https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/[Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies] are common, tolerated, and encouraged.
** Film Studios review screenplays in https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/hollywood_screenplay_format.xhtml[better formats and are communicative].
** Nevertheless, there are many franchises which are more "original", e.g https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/["The Enemy"] or https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/["HHFG"].
* A person can repair his body, mind or spirit without a lot of effort.
** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YhJxJZOWBw["Now I know kung-fu"] is not farfetched in the Selinaverse. However, to properly gain skill, one is expected to invest some learning / practicing effort (which should still be enjoyable).
* I am willing to give explicit public access to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records of me up to now: "Thu  3 Jun 08:41:16 IDT [Tel Aviv] 2021". My "nudes" and stupid/wrong/dirty thoughts and actions are a small price to pay for the good ones materialising.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence[Strong AIs] are already possible, but there is still some case for robotic/non-sentient AIs (e.g: game solvers/players; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant[Proof_assistants]; etc.)
* There are no calamities of nature: no extreme colds or extreme heats, no killer bees, no over-population, no world hunger, no extinctions of species, no diseases, epidemics or pandemics.
* Companies, NPOs, individuals, franchises, idea systems, etc. are paid by the development time and brands given duplication and distribution are costless. One can "pirate" such goods or create bootleg products, but it is considered noble to transfer profits upstream, downstream or sideways.
* People's minds emitting **thoughts** of "gods" (= "guideline-generators") with the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Ego[Ego] as an arbitter is a happy and virtuous state of being: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/crossover-hypothesis-about-the-origin-of-consciousness/
* Unlimited computing power.
* There are mind-reading text-editors, graphics-editors, etc.
* A kiss is enough to conceive children, without needing pregnancy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause[Menopause] does not happen.
* Instant messaging services are neither fragmented nor proprietary ( http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/How_Alternatives_Proliferate/ )

I'd be happy living in "The Terrestrial Bubble" for now, where people don't run into "supernatural" activity often and https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/indiv-nodes/the-master.xhtml[when they do, they think it may be a trick].

[id="history"]
History:
--------

The terrans were given several gifts of a blessing and a curse. Being hackers ( https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/ ) they often took the curse to their advantage:

1. body
2. mind: hearing voices of leaders
3. living forever (= 'jehovah')
4. knowledge: xref:#biblical_to_know[to know]
5. soul/ego: arbitter between the voices/thoughts
6. memory banks
7. humour: challenging truisms/falsisms
8. free will: the ability to decide to decide to do sth else.

Fear held Planet Earth in a mind hell. Humans had egoes but were "false prophets" and listened to Fear's mutations of the utterances of the gods/leaders and perceived reality differently in their mediums.

Nevertheless, many false prophets ascended, relinquished all their fears, and became fearless immortal "true prophets". That caused the psycho-geographical region to stop being a hellhole.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel[The Land_of_Israel] was particularly problematic because it was segmented into many territories.

In 1982, Selina Mandrake, a 1972-born American girl, engaged in a snailmail dialogue with the secretary of the USSR, and thanks to the terrestrial mass media infrastructure in place for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppet_Show[The_Muppet_Show] received so much coverage that all future newborns were automatically true prophets.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith[Samantha_Smith] is an echo of her, with a purposely common at the time name rather than the very rare "Mandrake" last name and "Selina" which was a variant of a then uncommon name: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selena_%28given_name%29["Selena"].

My https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/["Selina Mandrake - The Slayer (Buffy Parody)"] where the titular protagonist turns 18 in early 2012, can be thought of as an adversarial reboot/remake.

**update:** The bad Platonic ideals / "memes" / "demons" could love/know each other and others, but were not alive.

[id="terran-terminators"]
The Terran Terminators:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anyway, the devils did not give up easily, and did something cruel and unfair: they mostly erased the memory banks of the sentient men and women who have not reached enlightenment yet. In my case, it was https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/how_did_you_learn_english.xhtml[under the guise of kids mocking my English]. For most others, it was a concussion from a fall. Thing is: my https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/your_name.xhtml[first name means "Shalom-ful"] in Hebrew. The devils promised that my body will remain complete and whole.

FFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU, Fear!

We have nothing to fear! Including fear!

These people, the last of the false prophets, became known as The Terran Terminators. After relinquishing their fears, they have **ascended** so to speak (see https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Ascension ).

One of the first to ascend was https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/bad_acting_arnie.xhtml[Arnold Schwarzenegger].

Other notable Terran terminators:

. https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/biggest_celeb_crush.xhtml[Sarah Michelle Gellar (SMG)] - https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=smg-next-film["Summerschool at the NSA"] starring her may have been a thing.
. https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/nav-blocks/blocks/#xkcd_sect[Summer Glau] - my https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/["Summerschool at the NSA" film] likely earned her the Oscar and may have been a reboot.
. Likely https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart[Melissa Joan Hart (MJH)] (who ascended during https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa_Explains_It_All[CEIA] and as a result was the https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/So-Who-The-Hell-Is-Qoheleth/indiv-nodes/alpha-beta-gamma-omega.xhtml["beta" female] during the https://websitebuilders.com/how-to/glossary/web1/[Web 1.0 period] when SMG was "queen of the Web")
. Likely https://twitter.com/AliciaSilv[Alicia Silverstone]
. Likely https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman[Natalie Portman]
. Likely https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling[JKRowling]

I was convinced I was good , noble, well-intentioned and benevolent. I refused to permanently consider the opposite! Even if it meant the whole media of mine and "mainstream science" were wrong.

[id="history-more-about-selina"]
More about Selina Mandrake:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selina now found herself a multiverse heroine, part of the NSA's payroll, and
still wishing to lead a life as a human being, esp. one who was 10y.o. and
female.  Naturally she had many hackers/good-guys helpers, admirers, emulators, parodiers, remixers, critics, etc.

One note was that Selina blew some dandelions at a summer camp and was nicknamed "Puffy". She later shared an observation that the human mind had a limited immediate capacity of memory ( see https://shlomifish.livejournal.com/1991.html ), which combined with the computing concept of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_buffer["a buffer"] nicknamed her "Buffy".

The story of King Shlomi-son-of-David (the Biblical one):
---------------------------------------------------------

After Syria (minus Damascus itself) in the levant ascended to being a true
prophets zone (by Mosheh / Aharon / Nimrod ?), The-Curse splintered the modern
day State of Israel into 12 or 13 parts, and .uk into many shires and
Scottish clans and promised they won't do it again. Note that pre-Levantine
was modern Hebrew (which was spoken by https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/Q_home_planet.xhtml[the Englishtants over 6 milliard years ago]) and Modern English is also a product of The-Curse.

Anyway, the tribe of Yehudah (except their Capital Jerusalem) ascended when David "slayed" Goliath by almost hitting him with a sling (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE2TZAdoaS8["I missed on purpose; I can kill you now"]) and telling him the Judeans and Philistines should become friends.

Nevertheless, David or someone else entirely unrelated (possibly two false prophets parents) gave birth to a false prophet-at-first son in Jerusalem, as a booby trap to liberate Jerusalem. He became King "Shlomi" (written as "Shlomo" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_Codex[Aleppo Codex] ) which means https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/your_name.xhtml[Shalom-ful] in Hebrew. Shalom means “well-being”, “welfare”, "harmony", "wholeness", even "prosperity" - not "tranquility". While he could suffer some hardships and pain, his body, mind, soul and heart, must remain complete and intact and prosper.

King Shlomo wanted to be benevolent and "know the gods". He became king by telling jokes and tall tales about his older siblings-in-pretence (e.g: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_(daughter_of_David)[Amnon and Tamar]). Not unlike https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/[my fanfics/RPF]. They agreed he would be a better king and crowned him.

By the time of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith (and Selina Mandrake?) only [Gush Dan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Dan), which did not include "northern tel aviv" north of the Yarkon remained as a hell hole in the State of Israel. I was born there, possibly to two false prophets-at-the-time parents. I am fairly certain https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef (who may be much older than he looks and dresses in an extravagant but memorable alphet, not unlike Darth Vader) christened all the terran terminators as "pure Jews".

Despite my Youth (I am 1977-born, so am 44) I likely amassed many titles. But to quote a https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/Queen-Padme-Tales--The-Fifth-Sith-indiv-nodes/yoda-as-a-closet-Sith.xhtml[recent Fic of mine]

Yoda: the third sith is I. Created the legend of the Sith 2,000 years ago have
I. Tweeted about it now too have I.

[ Tweet by @Yoda: “The third sith is I. Created the legend of the Sith 2,000
years ago have I. "Master Darth Yoda" call me you can. Or just plain "Yoda"." ]

Anakin: way cool! But shouldn't Darth Yoda be the first Sith then?

Yoda: Matters not Sith number, as much as short-term quarterly gains.

Jokes aside, I appreciate the titles, but prefer to be called "Shlomi",
"Mr. Fish", or "Rindolf": https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#refer_or_address . I also am generous with https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=smg-about-giving-back-money-and-time[donating both money and time] .
