Hi turdennis!

First of all regarding 'promoting' my "weird religion", the concept of
"everyone should be a messiah" predates me. E.g: see the ["You are a Pope card"](https://www.principiadiscordia.com/downloads/pope_card.pdf)
from ["Principia Discordia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Discordia)
(which I have not read yet).

Otherwise, I decided to not care too much this time about people on this thread jumping to conclusions about my (personal and dynamic and non-missionary) idea system. If you wish to get the matters straight, read:

* https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/ - about my nickname and idea system.
* https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/ - my personal FAQ.
* https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/ - my newest major project of activism titled "Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as geeky imperatives (as of 2021)" . It tries to make the film industry flourish again.

These are all publicly and gratisly accessible web pages, which should be usable with client-side scripting disabled. I'll still love you if you don't wish to be better informed. I also do not mind people "diluting" my "Rindolfism" idea system as it's been done for most good or bad idea systems in the past, and I think people are good and will eventually find the truth. I believe in you.

Some people may think I have ulterior motives, but my main concern is helping Jenna, her viewers, fans of her works, and collaborators. I am "my brother's keeper"so to speak, and am content with helping or educating even only one person at a time, and I don't even require being credited. When [Christina Grimmie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie) was killed, I was scorched by hot water, and so now I am careful when dealing with mildly warm water; I [try to tell people how I feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUQsqBqxoR4) about what they do right and wrong, even if I am told I should not have said that.

OK, enough about Rindolfism. Do note that I decided that for the rest of this essay, following the links should not be compulsory, and all of them were not originated by me (but one is my copy of a Jenna Marbles video, that is not yet back on YouTube, and which I mirror on my domain).

----

Jenna is (AFAIK at least) a real life, living, intelligent, and physically healthy human being. As such, I want her to remain alive and not be unnecessarily unhappy. I wish it for every real life human being, even if they had a tarnished past or traditionally been looked down upon. And Jenna AFAIK have never even physically injured someone else.

Being naturally unhappy is, for example, saddened by a loved friend or relative dying (e.g: [Tiffany Alvord's dad passing away when she was in her 20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_yBN5J4Bjk) or the fact that I, a man, cried at my grandmother's funeral.). OTOH, being **unnaturally** unhappy is, for example, taking offence at someone calling you a ["sick, degenerate, demented, barbaric, naughty, freak"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNYI3iINXrQ), which Alice Cooper took as a compliment.

Granted, it takes many people time to grow a thicker skin, and one likely will always be offended on rarer and rarer occasions, but it is doable.

----

I think Jenna or whoever **are allowed** to take a hiatus from youtube or social media, if they feel like it. People often need a break or a change of life, and there is [more than one way to make a difference in this world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it).

----

That put aside, I disapprove of the fact that she removed access to most of her videos from youtube and its searches (while I still love her as a person). These videos are (mostly) her intellectual children, and she can be credited with writing, recording, editing, and uploading them (and may wish to gain fame, money, esteem, etc. from their popularity). Nevertheless, these videos effectively belong to everyone: those who watched them, and built upon them ("remixing": comments, video replies, parodies, hyperlinks, etc.).

From my experience as an Internet writer ("blogger"; of fiction and non-fiction) there is also a positive feedback loop with my readers and reviewers. That is why I try to avoid removing prominent web pages or breaking existing URLs (though I may add a note that they are outdated).

Jenna could (and still may be able to) selectively annotate some offensive videos saying she regrets posting them and that they should be viewed with caution and discretion. But like the ["NEVER GIVE UP!!!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE) meme video tells, most good creators have many perfectly innocent works, many approving fans, many "critics" who are just joking or being playful, and some critics who "disapprove of What You Say, But Will Defend to the Death Your Right to Say It" ( [Reference](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/06/01/defend-say/) ). And they far outnumber those who proclaimed that "Jenna should delete any and all 'offensive' videos" (of whom some may regret the self-censoring now).

Like [this video by Jenna](https://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/What%20Kid%20Shows%20Taught%20Me-ROZjaxT_0Hw.webm) ("What kid shows taught me") demonstrates, kids and adults who have watched [Power Rangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers)
in the 1990s are as unlikely to now be as politically incorrect as that show was, as those
who have read the Bible will be motivated to perform near-genocides (e.g:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levite%27s_concubine ).

I'm not accusing Jenna of not practising what she preached, just using a work she happened to create for support.

----

Anyway, I suggest that Jenna restores the videos, for her benefit and that of her fans and supportive critics ("Keep your friends close and enemies closer" -- https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II ). There is no point in aggravating a minor problem, with a graver real issue that inconveniences many good fans. The "media" (= people, even well-intentioned ones) will always argue about [which colour the bikeshed should be](http://bikeshed.com/), but it is usually safe to not take them too seriously.

And she should also know that I like her and believe in her and even if she erred in the past, she can forgive herself and learn from her past mistakes. If she wants to take a break from social media life, she can, but she should not penalise the well-meaning collaborators.

As a Hebrew speaker, I can testify that the Hebrew word ["Shalom"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom), which stems from the proto-Semitic ["salaam"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/%C5%A1al%C4%81m-), which stems from the Semitic base root for "completeness" and "wholeness", has a canonical meaning of "well-being", "welfare", and "harmony". But it can mean "prosperity" rather than "quiet" or tranquility. In the [ending of Kung Fu Panda 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBN77b4P39s) the protagonist, Po, who is an obese Panda, gets tired of laying idle next to his master ( Shifu ) who has reached inner peace after Po defeated the destructive antagonist. As a result, he suggests they both go and eat, an offer which Shifu accepts. I think humans [dislike being idle](http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html) for too long when awake.

So I think while homicide and premature physical deaths are on a decline (minus a few outliers), we'll not see fewer verbal arguments and noise on "the media" (= people who can comment) and humanity still has many intellectual and physical issues to overcome. So "You gotta be bad, bold, wiser, hard, tough and stronger" to quote [Des'ree's song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO40TcKa_5U). There are friends who can help you though, including online ones.
