Hi turdennis!

First of all regarding 'promoting' my "weird religion", the concept of
"everyone is a messiah" predates me. E.g: see the ["You are a Pope card"](https://www.principiadiscordia.com/downloads/pope_card.pdf)
from ["Principia Discordia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Discordia)
(which I have not read yet).

Otherwise, I decided to not care too much this time about people on this thread jumping to conclusions about my (personal and dynamic and non-missionary) idea system. If you wish to get the matters straight, read:

* https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/ - about my nickname and idea system.
* https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/ - my personal FAQ.
* https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/ - my latest intellectual and activist (and altruistic but somewhat self-indulging) project titled "Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as geeky imperatives (as of 2021)" about trying to make the film industry flourish again by subverting some unfortunate "rules" (= guidelines) that they adopted. I might fail, but I plan to try for now (and it likely won't be the ultimate challenge that humanity faces).

These are all publicly and gratisly accessible web pages, which should be usable with client-side scripting disabled. I'll still love you if you don't wish to be better informed. I also do not mind people "diluting" my "Rindolfism" idea system as it's been done for all good or bad idea systems in the past, and I think people are good and will eventually find the truth. I believe in you.

OK, enough about Rindolfism.

Jenna is (AFAIK at least) a real life, living, intelligent, and physically healthy human being. As such, I want her to stay alive and not be unnecessarily unhappy. I wish it for every real life human being, even if they have traditionally been looked down upon. And Jenna AFAIK have never even physically injured someone else.

Being naturally unhappy is, for example, saddenned by a loved friend or relative dying (e.g: [Tiffany Alvord's dad passing away when she was in her 20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_yBN5J4Bjk) or the fact I, a man, cried at my grandmother's funeral.). OTOH, being **unnaturally** happy is, for example, taking offence at someone [calling you a "sick, degenerate, demented, barbaric, naughty, freak"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNYI3iINXrQ) which Alice Cooper took as a compliment.

Granted, it takes many people time to grow a thick skin, and one likely always be offended at times, but it is doable.

----

I think Jenna or whoever can take a hiatus from youtube or social media. People often need a break, and there is [more than one way to make a difference in this world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it).

----

That put aside, I disapprove of the fact that she removed access to most of her videos from youtube and its searches (while I still love her as a person). These videos are (mostly) her intellectual children, and she can be creditted with writing, recording, editing, uploading (and may wish to gain fame, money, etc. from their popularity). Nevertheless, these videos effectively belong to everyone: those who watched them, and built upon them ("remixing": comments, video replies, parodies).

Jenna could (and still may be able to) selectively annotate some offensive videos saying she regrets posting them and that they should be viewed with viewers' caution. But like the ["NEVER GIVE UP!!!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE) meme video tells most good creators have many perfectly innocent works, many approving fans, many "critics" who are just joking or being playful, and some critics who "disapprove of What You Say, But Will Defend to the Death Your Right to Say It" ( [Reference](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/06/01/defend-say/) ). And they far outnumber those who proclaim that "Jenna should delete any and all 'offensive' videos", but may regret the censoring now.

Like [this video by Jenna](https://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/What%20Kid%20Shows%20Taught%20Me-ROZjaxT_0Hw.webm) ("what kid shows taught me") demonstrates kids and adults who have watched [Power Rangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers)
in the 1990s are as unlikely to be as politically incorrect as they were now as those
who have read the Bible will be to motivated to perform near-genocides (e.g:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levite%27s_concubine ).

I'm not accusing Jenna of not practising what she preached, just using a work she happened to create for support.

----

Anyway, I suggest that Jenna restores the videos, for her benefit and that of her fans and supportive critics ("Keep your friends close and enemies closer" -- https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II ). There is no point in aggravting a minor offence (pardon the pun) with a graver real issue that inconvenciences many good fans. The "media" (= people, even well-intentioned ones) will always argue about [which colour the bikeshed should be](http://bikeshed.com/), but it is usually safe to not take them too seriously.

And she should also know that I like her and believe in her and even if she erred in the past, she can forgive herself and learn from her past mistakes. If she wants to take a break from social media life, she can, but please don't penalise the well-meaning collaborators.

As a Hebrew speaker, I can testify that the Hebrew word ["Shalom"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom), which stems from the proto-Semitic ["salaam"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/%C5%A1al%C4%81m-), which stems from the base root for "completeness" and "wholeness", and has a canonical meaning of "well-being", "welfare", and "harmony", can mean "prosperity" rather than "quiet" or tranquility. In the [ending of Kung Fu Panda 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBN77b4P39s) the protagonist, Po, who is an obese Panda, gets tired of laying idle next to his master ( Shifu ) who has reached peace of mind after Po defeated the dangerous antagonistt. As a result, he suggests they both go and grab a bite, which Shifu accepts.
