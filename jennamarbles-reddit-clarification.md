Hi turdennis!

First of all regarding 'promoting' my "weird religion", the concept of
"everyone is a messiah" predates me. E.g: see the ["You are a Pope card"](https://www.principiadiscordia.com/downloads/pope_card.pdf)
from ["Principia Discordia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Discordia)
(which I have not read yet).

Otherwise, I decided to not care too much this time about people on this thread jumping to conclusions about my (personal and dynamic and non-missionary) idea system. If you wish to get the matters straight, read:

* https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/ - about my nickname and idea system.
* https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/ - my personal FAQ.
* https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/ - my latest intellectual and activist (and altruistic but somewhat self-indulging) project titled "Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as geeky imperatives (as of 2021)" about trying to make the film industry flourish again by subverting some unfortunate "rules" (= guidelines) that they adopted. I might fail, but I plan to try for now (and it likely won't be the ultimate challenge that humanity faces).

These are all publicly and gratisly accessible web pages, which should be usable with client-side scripting disabled. I'll still love you if you don't wish to be better informed. I also do not mind people "diluting" my "Rindolfism" idea system as it's been done for all good or bad idea systems in the past, and I think people are good and will eventually find the truth. I believe in you.

OK, enough about Rindolfism
