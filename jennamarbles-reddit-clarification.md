Hi turdennis!

First of all regarding 'promoting' my "weird religion", the concept of
"everyone is a messiah" predates me. E.g: see the ["You are a Pope card"](https://www.principiadiscordia.com/downloads/pope_card.pdf)
from ["Principia Discordia"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Discordia)
(which I have not read yet).

Otherwise, I decided to not care too much this time about people on this thread jumping to conclusions about my (personal and dynamic and non-missionary) idea system. If you wish to get the matters straight, read:

* https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/ - about my nickname and idea system.
* https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/ - my personal FAQ.
* https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/ - my latest intellectual and activist (and altruistic but somewhat self-indulging) project titled "Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as geeky imperatives (as of 2021)" about trying to make the film industry flourish again by subverting some unfortunate "rules" (= guidelines) that they adopted. I might fail, but I plan to try for now (and it likely won't be the ultimate challenge that humanity faces).

These are all publicly and gratisly accessible web pages, which should be usable with client-side scripting disabled. I'll still love you if you don't wish to be better informed. I also do not mind people "diluting" my "Rindolfism" idea system as it's been done for all good or bad idea systems in the past, and I think people are good and will eventually find the truth. I believe in you.

OK, enough about Rindolfism.

Jenna is (AFAIK at least) a real life, living, intelligent, and physically healthy human being. As such, I want her to stay alive and not be unnecessarily unhappy. I wish it for every real life human being, even if they have traditionally been looked down upon. And Jenna AFAIK have never even physically injured someone else.

Being naturally unhappy is, for example, saddenned by a loved friend or relative dying (e.g: [Tiffany Alvord's dad passing away when she was in her 20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_yBN5J4Bjk) or the fact I, a man, cried at my grandmother's funeral.). OTOH, being **unnaturally** happy is, for example, taking offence at someone [calling you a "sick, degenerate, demented, barbaric, naughty, freak"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNYI3iINXrQ) which Alice Cooper took as a compliment.

Granted, it takes many people time to grow a thick skin, and one likely always be offended at times, but it is doable.

I think Jenna or whoever can take a hiatus from youtube or social media. People often need a break, and there is [more than one way to make a difference in this world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it).

That put aside, I disapprove of the fact that she removed access to most of her videos from youtube and its searches (while still loving her as a person). These videos are (mostly) her intellectual children, and she can be creditted with writing, recording, editing, uploading (and may wish to gain fame, money, etc. on their popularity).
