'''The Beckyverse''' called after [[Becky Shepherd (Beckyverse)|Becky Shepherd]], who is the protagonist and main introduced character of the screenplay [[Buffy: a Few Good Slayers]], is a world created by [[Shlomi Fish]]. In the Beckyverse, [[Faith (Beckyverse)|Faith]] saved the day at the last minute, and eventually joined the [[Scooby Gang]], and they all ended up more empowered and happier.

The Beckyverse is a parallel world to the [[Selinaverse]] that was also created by Shlomi Fish.

Some of the '''highlights''' of the Beckyverse are:

* [[wikipedia:Sarah Michelle Gellar|Sarah Michelle Gellar]] (= "SMG") was not born in the Beckyverse, and instead [[wikipedia:Natalia Portman]] was the "Alpha Female" of the [[wikipedia:Web 1.0|Web 1.0]] age (And a little later).
* Portman’s reign as Alpha Female ended after her playing the supporting role in the highly acclaimed 2001/2002 mini-series show [[Sarah the Vampire Slayer]], which was produced by [[Joss Whedon]] who until then was primarily known for [http://firefly.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page Firefly].
** The show was inspired by [[Buffy (Beckyverse)|Buffy]]’s life and imagination, where she believed she has a kindred spirit and alter-ego called Sarah, who is an ethnic American Jew and was the alpha female at one time. This turns out to be none other than the [[Sarah Michelle Gellar (Selinaverse)|SMG from the Selinaversa]].
* Several other real-life personas such as [[wikipedia:Chuck Norris|Chuck Norris]], [http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/ Summmer Glau], and [[Shlomi Fish]] himself are referenced in the story.f
