I hope and believe Joss Whedon is a better person now. So whatever happened ( the past is a mystery - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon and everyone remembers it differently ) we should let bygones be bygones ( http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/ ; [Yahweh=="what is and what will be" shall be your guideline generator"](https://github.com/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage/blob/master/lib/asciidocs/about-the-origins-of-consciousness-craziness-and-normativity-conformism-and-nevua.asciidoc) ; "let it be" ; "let it go"; "hakuna matata"; etc. etc.).

Maybe Carpenter thought Whedon was being mean. He may have been, and [Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) noted that "All language designers are arrogant. Comes with the territory." and I can attest that it is also true for creators of fiction too, so Whedon may have been conceit or mad or unreasonable too. I've been too when I was younger, but I [am hopefully wiser](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-perl-older-and-wiser) and [less being a dick](https://dontbeadickday.com/) and so hopefully Whedon is.

A lot of the Christian conquerors that [Saladin forgave](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=saladin&atb=v140-1&ia=web) had killed many innocent civilians, but he knew that "an eye to an eye makes the whole world blind" and that punishing them was detrimental (and Saladin's military had to kill many Christians militants to protect themselves). I only know of [one Christian warrior to have returned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Heaven_%28film%29)
and given Saladin forgave him for breaking his oath, fought so poorly that he lost
the battle quickly. He permanently gave up on fighting Saladin, and ended up
raising a family.

Even if Joss Whedon was being mean, I'm sure whatever female (or male) warriors
and action heroes ([and what I identify as "hackers"](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/take2/#hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional) - think "bending the rules" like Indiana Jones' gun vs swordmaster scene) can - forgive him for that, understanding that he was likely being candid even if - tactless, under stress, and lacking delivery.

Even if they cannot let go emotionally, they should by words and deeds. What
doesn't kill you make you stronger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OJZAmRFWEk .
It's probably all for the best.

Humanity's quest for [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/%C5%A1al%C4%81m-]("Salaam" / "Shalom")
which I hypothesise meant "prosperity", "excitement", "enlightenment", "harmony"
in addition to "well being", "welfare", and "peace" is not over.
We still have to fight many guidelines mascarding as rules or laws or dogma.
Some people are being physically injured or are dying prematurely.
And our most effective weapons are our technologies: both the tangible ones
but also [education / entertainment](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=education-and-entertainment).
