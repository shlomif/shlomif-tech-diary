@Alex Blue  Hi! Sorry for misspeaking, and thanks for replying! I'm glad you're back on YouTube again and hope everything is, was, and is going to be OK.

Do note that I have two pages on a wiki I maintain  - one about encouraging others to criticise you - http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/ - and there is a complementary one about not trying to please everyone: http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Never_Try_to_Please_Everyone/ . There will always be a lot of white noise in the media.

Do note that I now suspect (but am not sure) that a person's perceived attractiveness has less to do with their haircut and more to do with their confidence, given some women are bald and yet look great: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-beauty-products-as-the-stone-soup-effect

( I still think you're beautiful, and like many  of your songs either way,
