I recall a scene from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_in_the_Big_City where a party door-keeper asks General Specific "are you cool?" and he answers "Yes, I'm cool" to which the door-keeper says "Cool people never say they are cool. It is uncool!". So the General says "OK, so I'm not coolâ€¦ I'm a loser. Can I enter?" and the door-keeper says "But you just admitted that you're not cool!". So the general mutters "I hate those catch-twenty-fours!".
