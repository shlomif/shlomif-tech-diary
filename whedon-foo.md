Regarding your second point: I believe the misconduct **was** ultimately caused by the aversion towards (fan)fiction, and I'm trying to fix the root cause. Frankly, Joss Whedon (or George Lucas or Spielberg or Mel Brooks or Jim Henson&amp;Co for that matter) have to my knowledge never directly physically killed or permanently injured anyone, because technology (both tangible and intellectual) was more advanced at their time than that of [Saladin](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/), who ended up killing some enemies and possibly his own troops.

Regarding my plan: I am not alone, and invite everyone else to join me. Even if we appear to be underpowered:

* ["Never underestimate the power of the schwartz"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAGuYr3hpR4&amp;t=2924s)
* ["Little Buddha - Awakening scene"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPOviqxFllA)
* [Elijah and the Ba'al nevi'im](https://www.gotquestions.org/Elijah-prophets-Baal.html)

They said open source will not win. Nowadays, Microsoft and Apple has a lot of FOSS contributions and even [EA](https://github.com/electronicarts) has a github account. They said that wikipedia was a fad. Quite a few YouTuber cover/etc. artists (as well as NiN's [Ghosts I-IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_I%E2%80%93IV)) made commercial but open/free-in-effect music a reality.

Will I/we succeed? We may not, but I still intend to try. This is part of my role as a [hacker

Whose side are you on: that of the anti-fanfic laws/regulations/court precedents/"beliefs" (read: "guidelines" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJVBvvS57j0 )? Or that of mine/us (see: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/originality_is_self_defeating.xhtml ).
