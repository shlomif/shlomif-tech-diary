Here's an email I sent to the wikimedia gendergap mailing list ( https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/gendergap ) which didn't arrive yet because my messages have to be manually accepted there with some delay (due to going offtangent in the past and something I accept):

First of all, congrats to Lila for her accomplishment! ♥!

That put aside, I dislike these "100 most powerful people/women" list, and let
me explain why. I think every person (a man, a woman, of any age/etc.) when
asked "Who is the most powerful person on Earth?" should answer with "I am.".
Similarly, every person should consider himself the Messiah and act accordingly
(while still leading a proper life). See:

old mentality of mine, but still pertinent).

(newer and quite better)

Thinking that the U.S. President, or the Roman Catholic Pope, or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales or whoever are more powerful than
you is not a good idea. I came up with this question and its answer back in
1997 when I was studying in the Technion for the first year, having worked
in previous workplaces and watched a lot of mid-to-late-90s
American/Israel/etc. television, being introduced to the early Web 1.0
Internet, and also having read and inspired by a lot of stuff I read about
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29 and its
http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/guide-to-neo-tech/ spinoff
(which I was initially quite dogmatic above, but now quite critical of it, and
also am now a pluralist and spiritual agnostic and also -
http://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolfism ).

Anyway, I asked two of my neighbours in the building about it and they told me
"Bill Clinton? [= the U.S. President at the time] Bill Gates? I don't know."
and then I gave them my answer. Then I asked my roommate, who was a Technion
graduate in Electrical Enginnering and worked as an Electrical Engineer nearby,
and his (gay) boyfriend that and they thought for a moment and then replied "I
am" and "I am" in succession. Since then, a kiosk owner in a local kiosk in my
Tel Aviv neighbourhood, and an English teenager I talked with on IRC (and who
wanted to become better at programming) gave what I believe is the correct
answer.

[I know I went off-tangent, so feel free to either drop this E-mail from being
sent to the gendergap list, not reply, or reply in private. It's not
sexualised at all, and I think it gives some good food for thought.]

Here are a few other things:

Sesame Street / The Muppets Show / etc. and Jim Henson who was their poster child, received a lot of criticism back then for spoiling the youth, coating learning with a suger coating, encouraging illiteracy, etc. etc. Many of the Sesame Street skits are funny rehearses of concepts known from antiquity: Aesop's Fables, the Aristotlean writings, from the Jewish Bible, the Greek Mythology and the rest of the Greek philosophy - but possibly much earlier than that (Summerian/Ancient-Egyptian writing and before). Many people said that children should read those in books.

But guess what? Not only did most children and adults who watched Sesame Street grew up to be literate and happy, but most of the shakers and movers who grew up during the late 1960s 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s (or possibly later) have watched Sesame Street - http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#best_warriors . Moreover, most of the American television shows at the time ( e.g: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek%3A_The_Original_Series ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Time_Tunnel ; or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission%3A_Impossible ) were positively paranoid, aggressive, and scary. On the other,  Sesame Street depicted a peaceful street, where children (both real-life and muppets) , adults, muppets, animals, and - pleasant and even friendly monsters (!!) live together happily, safely, harmoniously, and without fear, thus changing the fate of the cold war forever.

From there it was relatively easy to get to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith the mighty warrior (and a 10 years old girl) who slew two mighty nations, and later on Star Trek: The Next Generation, and further warrior kings or queens: https://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/gyrcAfAASev . Furthermore, somewhere starting at 2001 (and a little before) I took over the role of Warrior King and Warrior Queen and decided I will change the world and lead it from worse to better to even better - http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/the-eternal-jew/change_the_world.html .

I may not have been the best man for the job: a young Israeli Jewish straight and mostly unathletic man  living in Ramat Aviv Gimmel (kinda lika a Gult's Gulch of Tel Aviv), incredibly obscure and unknown, who suffered from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder (= "Mania Depressia"), was tactless, quite lonely, had bad diction and was often quiet, and who found joy in attending tech meetings, and who was quite ascetic, and who spent most of his time sitting on the computer working on code and content for his home site ( http://www.shlomifish.org/ ), for blogs, and later on other trends, but I know one thing: I wanted to be the warrior king the most badly and didn't let any obstacle delay me forever, and while I had my share of frustrations and failures, I only came stronger.

Like Shakespeare's Sister say in https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hello+shakespeare%27s+sister “life [love?] is a strange thing
just when you think you learned how to use it it's gone", and now I realise I am no longer the warrior monarch, or won't be one for long. The woman who seized this title, and that I gladly passed the baton to is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau , a relatively obscure American actress, who had several major roles on Television, but is primarily notable for being featured in the cult xkcd comic and later being featured on my ongoing screenplay and meme - Summerschool at the NSA - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ . In this screenplay, she (and not her highly unrealistic characters) successfully vanquish the paranoidly-protected National Security Agency, using special warfare that is completely non-violent and non-destructive, making everyone involved saner, grateful and happier as a result. Saladin style! ( See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Heaven_%28film%29 ).

I have a lot of advice to offer Summer (or whoever):

1. Believe in yourself: even if you had a checkered past, it does not mean you can become better and more competent in the future in areas that used to be your vice. I don’t expect you to be good at anything, and contrary to popular belief, an independent person often requests or even pays for help and advice.

2. Be yourself: as long as you don’t do anything really evil (e.g: driving drunk, killing or injuring someone voluntarily, spreading vicious lies (= defamation), shouting "Fire!" in a crowded hall, etc.) you can do "what the fuck you want to" (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL , which is a fun and inspiring joke, but not a really recommended software licence).

Whatever your choices will be some people will be unhappy, so it’s safe to ignore them, be proud of yourself and what you’ve done, and just move on, and making a wrong decision or doing something sub-optimal is usually better than not doing anything at all: http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#trying_to_please_everybody

I intend and plan on materialising a film production of Summerschool at the NSA, but even if you (= Summer) would rather not play there for whatever reasons, that's OK. It may sound crazy, but I think https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox will be wonderful as you (= Summer Glau) in that production, which I plan and hope, will be done soon. Summer will have enough chances to star in a lead film role and win the Oscar’s .

3. Make your own kind of music: don't worry if what you create or produce seems inferior to people you liked in the past. I envied the fact that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand wrote much more coherently and lucidly than I did, but it seems that she felt the same way about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment which is a book that I struggled with and detested far more than either https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged , both of which I found entertaining and inspiring (despite being quite "WTF?"-y in this day and age).

Similarly, I think a lot of the current and future generations will appreciate my more staccato-like way of writing informal screenplays , funny bits , aphorisms and even factoids about people, characters and things ( http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/ ), than the tomes that Ayn Rand wrote, however well-written and awesome they are (and I took the liberty to modernise them in http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOWTF/ and in Summerschool at the NSA, while referencing them in both cases).
