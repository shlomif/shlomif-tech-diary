Dear foodstirs.com,

please forward this message to Ms. Sarah Michelle Gellar-Prinze (or
otherwise let me know why you chose not to.). It is not directly
related to foodstirs but I found the link on https://twitter.com/SarahMGellar
and she doesn't seem too responsive on social media sites.

Hi Sarah Michelle,

I'd like to interest you in my plan to heal the film and fiction industries
and help heal the world in general - all while improving yourself,
enjoying yourself, and possibly becoming richer and more famous. I hope
you'll reply back using my contact infos: https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/ this time.

Anyway, you can read my mission statement here:

https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/

"Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as geeky
imperatives (as of 2021)"

(Essay of mini essays embellished with quotes, image memes, and embedded
youtube videos; CC-by licence)

As I note, there is a shift of attractive ("beautiful", "hot", etc.) and/or
skillful and competent people (of any age, gender, and past experience)
increasingly being geeky (= "amateur", loving their work and endeavour) and
"hackers" (= action heroes, rule benders, resourceful, defying their fate) and
not only the alphas, but mainstream and majority.  Combined with the open /
free / share / remix / "steal" trend (open source, open content, web 2.0,
user-generated content, generosity, etc.), it makes most screenwriters not
bother massaging their screenplays into the Hollywood format, and worse - write
their screenplays as crossovers, real person fiction, and parodies - including
of recently created commercial and "all rights reserved" works and franchises,
and living and young people.

Moreover, most geeky and attractive actors (from Emma Watson or the 2021
Natalie Portman or the 2021 you to obscure attractive waiters or waitresses in
Los Angeles) will refuse playing in non-geeky/hacky screenplays, even for all
the money in the world.

I give a plan for the way forward to break this "vicious" cycle.
