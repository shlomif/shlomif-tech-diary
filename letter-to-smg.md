Dear foodstirs.com,

please forward this message to Ms. Sarah Michelle Gellar-Prinze (or
otherwise let me know why you chose not to.). It is not directly
related to foodstirs but I found the link on https://twitter.com/SarahMGellar
and she doesn't seem too responsive on social media sites.

Hi Sarah Michelle,

I'd like to interest you in my plan to heal the film and fiction industries
and help heal the world in general - all while improving yourself,
enjoying yourself, and possibly becoming richer and more famous. I hope
you'll reply back using my contact infos: https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/ this time.

Anyway, you can read my mission statement here:

https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/

"Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as geeky
imperatives (as of 2021)"

"Let's make (fan)-fiction great again!"

(Essay which consists of mini essays embellished with quotes, image memes, and
embedded youtube videos; CC-by licence)

As I note, there is a shift of attractive ("beautiful", "hot", etc.) and/or
skillful and competent people (of any age, gender, and past experience)
increasingly being both geeky (= "amateur", loving their work and endeavour)
and "hackers" (= action heroes, rule benders, resourceful, defying their fate).
Moreover, not only the alphas, but have become the mainstream and majority.
Combined with the open / free / share / remix / "steal" trend (open source,
open content, web 2.0, user-generated content, generosity, etc.), it makes most
screenwriters not bother massaging their screenplays into the Hollywood format,
and worse - write their screenplays as crossovers, real person fiction, and
parodies - including of recently created commercial and "all rights reserved"
works and franchises, and living and relatively young real-world people.

Moreover, most geeky and attractive actors (from Emma Watson or the 2021
Natalie Portman or the 2021 Jack Black, Chuck Norris, or you, to obscure
attractive waiters or waitresses in Los Angeles) will refuse playing in
non-geeky/hacky screenplays, even for all the money in the world.

I give a plan for the way forward to break this "vicious" cycle.

I'm a big fan of some of your work (Buffy, and the Spiderman and LotR parodies)
and consider you my "biggest celebrity
crush" and a huge source of inspiration and a role model, and suggest you start producing
quality fanfic screenplays (whether yours, mine, or others) and I can help
you by dedicating time and energy (since I'm not rich yet, I can only offer
so little money that no "big name" film star will bother getting out of bed -
hah! Just kidding.

Regarding the accusations of Joss Whedon being abusive and offending the women
on his set, I think it was a side effect of the fact that after ~1999-2000, the
"web 2.0"/open content trend was in place, and more and more geeky and hackery
wannabe screenwriters or writers, got their feet wet with learning HTML,
software dev, graphics editing, etc. and publishing online.  Moreover, BtVS
stopped being broadcast in Israel, and made some unfortunate plot decisions.

I'm not sure whether he was less abusive toward the men employees, but most
women have traditionally been more easily offended and they were relatively
common in Whedon's shows. If not taken Stoically by either or both sides
( https://shlomifish.livejournal.com/1747.html ) such relationships
can escalate.

I think both Joss and his employees will be happier producing fanfics.

Happy upcoming Passover, Easter, etc.
