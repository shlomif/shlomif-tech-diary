<para>
Like it or not, in the Selinaverse and Shlomifverse, pleasure (and a possible precluding temporary pain), education, and creativity/conception are intertwined. While we can imagine realities where they are not, they will be, well, different to ours.

<para>
Angels starting like that are hereby referred to as "false prophets" (where <link xl:href="https://shlom.in/geekyhackers">"prophet" or "navi" meant "madman" in Ancient Hebrew</link>) or as "vampires".
That was until they reached enough "enlightenment" and became "true prophets" (or "wizards").

However, his long-time associate <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_and_false_(commands)">"/bin/true"</link> v2.0 "The Strong AI Edition"

the gamemasters preferred space-friendly pens to be developed (within budget).
Moreover, faster-than-light ("FTL") travel is possible given one can cross
gateways to planets many lightyears away in a matter of seconds.
However, it is a useful constraint that, after it was upheld, made technology
better designed.

It was a process by which the Satans tried to convince 'false prophets'

As a watcher, <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart">Melissa Joan Hart (MJH)</link> was ambitious, and possibly overly so. She used
<link xlink:href="https://spaceballs.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Helmet">Dark Helmet from <emphasis>Spaceballs</emphasis></link>
as an anti-role-model. However, her liberal use of time warps and time travel
(which likely were employed by <link xlink:href="#slayer-watcher-whicher">Maimonides</link> before) earned her the unflattering nickname "World's oldest teenager".

When Emma Watson volunteered to help manage me and Rindolf, she started as a SysCo
(= "system coordinator") and requested 100,000 USD/month as a wage (as a starting
point for haggling) and MJH was happy to comply right away.
When news broke about it, Watson was in tears, but MJH told her they saw
an increase in donations and that "War is good for business". So she
gave Emma a raise, and made her "a vice president in charge of marketing".
</para>

<para>
In 1995, Emma Watson and her parents relocated from Paris, to Tel Aviv and
Greater London, as by that time, she provided most income, and her parents
were helping her. This was motivated by the desire to reduce context switches,
and because the Parisians she talked with were annoyed by her absentmindedly
using English and Hebrew paradigms in speech.

With Emma's help, <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/biggest_celeb_crush.xhtml">Sarah Michelle Gellar (SMG)</link> was terminated by my team, and

One thing Emma Watson disapproved of was a liberal use of time wraps and time
travel. She wanted to have a rough sense of the passage of the "real time" and
so used them only during emergencies. She instead depended on other wizard
helpers, including those that temporarily assumed her appearance using magic.
MJH agreed to disagree on that with her given Watson and her team still got a
lot done.
</para>

<para>
However, at ~1997/1998, MJH was hoping to get me terminated ASAP, but the devils
fought back and filled my head with fictional delusions. After I sided
with Watson ("real time" and <quote>your time is everybody's time</quote>),
MJH passed the leadership to her, and decided to limit her
own use of time wraps. Melissa remained part of my/Rindolf/Emma
Watson's team.

<para>
I recall that having read <link xlink:href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone">the first Harry Potter book</link> by
JK Rowling, I found it enjoyable and accessible, but not as good as
past children's literature I had read.
<link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#opinion_on_harry_potter">The
subsequent terrestrial books took themselves too seriously</link>. Anyway, part
of Emma's motivation in playing Hermione
in the first Harry Potter film, was for getting <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1511632946658258946">me to register her existence</link>.
She and the other actors were also instructed to play <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1486799232971464704">hackily and in a "so bad it's good" manner</link> since they didn't want
to be kept on the filming set for long.

<para>
At ~2011 when I wrote <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html">the proposed cast page of <emphasis>Selina Mandrake - The Slayer</emphasis></link>,
I picked her to play Selina.
At 2014 when <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-perl-jobs-EmWatson-Saladin-knights-Templar">someone on freenode’s #perl insulted Emma’s looks</link>, I felt like he was being blasphemous (= <link xlink:href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9">"חילול הקודש"</link>). Watson was not a mere actress for me.
Someone on freenode noted that Selina resembled me
at ~2020. The lives of Emma, <link xlink:href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Kate_(Selinaverse)">Milady Kate</link> and me have paralleled (non-coincidentally).
</para>

<para>
While Emma started as easily hurt, and overreacting/overemotional, (not unlike me)
she eventually <link xlink:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">developed a thicker skin</link>
(also like I did). As a result, she was increasingly able to play herself
(rather than relying on "stunt doubles"/lookalikes)
including on <link xlink:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/how_do_you_expect_to_afford_the_actors.xhtml">indie films</link>,

If we are to believe <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito%2c%5fergo%5fsum">Cogito, ergo sum</link> , the only thing I can be sure of is that I exist. However, as cool as I may be, I doubt my mind alone could conceive the awesome action heroes listed <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/indiv-nodes/notable-hacker-monarchs.xhtml">on this page</link> including Saladin, Walt Disney, Jim Henson, and Aristotle - most of whom have ample evidence for being real. And given my present mediocre Inkscape 2-D vector graphics skills, I am enthralled even by the 2-and-a-half dimensions graphics of 1990s computer games (e.g: <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_2%3A_LeChuck%27s_Revenge">Monkey Island 2</link> ; <link xl:href="https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Street_Fighter_II_%28series%29">Street Fighter II</link> ; <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_Glory_III:_Wages_of_War">Quest for Glory III</link>) and those of <link xl:href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</link> .

Nevertheless, when a friend gives you a link to a tweet, or a song, or a
captioned image, or a short Sesame Street skit - don't tell him you are
now focusing on Ancient Greek philosophy. Moreover, traditional classical

I also want to attend some Satanists' conventions. I'm still a big fan of
<link xlink:href="#the-devils">the Satans</link>
despite them deceiving me and making me endure pain and
discomfort. Moreover, I likely had an easier time than even my father's father
who escaped from the Nazis through the west USSR, and Iran, until settling in Tel Aviv.
I have been willing to suffer a little more, if it meant that future generations will suffer much
less. And as I like to say "If I didn't want excitement in my life, then <link xlink:href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/">I'd go watch grass grow</link>".

In a way, I've been doing <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Hegelian_dialectic">a Hegelian dialectic</link>
