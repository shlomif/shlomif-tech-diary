"Fair" has the following meanings in English:

1. Fair in spirit: just.

2. Fair in form: beautiful, pretty.

To add to the confusion, "strong" can mean:

1. Strong in spirit: persistent, unimpressable, does not give up, confident.

2. Strong in form: athletic.

Whether males or females are in general better in any of these qualities
is some thing I am confused about at the moment.
