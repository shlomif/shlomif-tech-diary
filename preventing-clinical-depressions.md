Title: Preventing Clinical Depressions and Suicides

As you are aware [Robin Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams), the highly acclaimed Hollywood actor and comedian, was recently found dead in his home, and suspected to have committed suicide. Being a big fan of Williams, I was shocked to learn of his death, and saddened to learn that he apparently committed suicide.

I immediately remembered the poem [“Richard Cory”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cory) by Edwin Arlington Robinson, which «describes a person who is wealthy, well educated, mannerly, and admired by the people in his town. Despite all this, he takes his own life. ». Now, despite common belief, suicide is not normally caused by a lifetime of unhappiness and contempt to oneself, but is normally caused by the so-called [“Major depressive disorder”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) or clinical depression, which is not the same as being "depressed" or "down" and certainly is not [sadness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadness) during which a person is still essentially happy and content.
