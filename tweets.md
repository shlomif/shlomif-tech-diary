Re spiderman, I recall having watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCl3ho6_gbg w @SarahMGellar & @jackblack before I watched the orig film (w @kirstendunst / etc.) found it funny. Then as I watched the orig, I said in my mind "now I know why that was funny."  several times.

I like Dani Cimorelli so much, but I feel guilty thinking she is sexy. The reason is thatby 2001 her mother, discovered my sites and was impressed, and "raped me in her heart". There's nothing ppl can do about that and I don't want to.

This reddit post likely made Ms. Strong's twitter more popular. And good for her, because I'm a big fan of her.

I also have a hypothesis that, like it or not, here in the Selinaverse and shlomifverse, pleasure (and a possible precluding temporary pain), education, and creativity/conception are intertwined. While we can imagine realities where they arent, they'll be… different. https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/multiverse-cosmology-v0.4.x.asciidoc .
