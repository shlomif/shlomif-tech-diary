Re spiderman, I recall having watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCl3ho6_gbg w @SarahMGellar & @jackblack before I watched the orig film (w @kirstendunst / etc.) found it funny. Then as I watched the orig, I said in my mind "now I know why that was funny."  several times.

This reddit post likely made Ms. Strong's twitter more popular. And good for her, because I'm a big fan of her.

I also have a hypothesis that, like it or not, here in the Selinaverse and shlomifverse, pleasure (and a possible precluding temporary pain), education, and creativity/conception are intertwined. While we can imagine realities where they arent, they'll be… different. https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/multiverse-cosmology-v0.4.x.asciidoc .

War and Peace might not be at odds.

"Philosophy" means "the love of wisdom", and "amateur" means "someone who works for the love of it".

As a result, when I described myself as an "amateur philosopher", there could have been some redundancy.

The scroll of Qoheleth, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes , is short, written in accessible Hebrew, and contains many gems. However:
