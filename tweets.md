Re spiderman, I recall having watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCl3ho6_gbg w @SarahMGellar & @jackblack before I watched the orig film (w @kirstendunst / etc.) found it funny. Then as I watched the orig, I said in my mind "now I know why that was funny."  several times.

This reddit post likely made Ms. Strong's twitter more popular. And good for her, because I'm a big fan of her.

I also have a hypothesis that, like it or not, here in the Selinaverse and shlomifverse, pleasure (and a possible precluding temporary pain), education, and creativity/conception are intertwined. While we can imagine realities where they arent, they'll be… different. https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/multiverse-cosmology-v0.4.x.asciidoc .

That's a fun and wonderful recording! thanks for sharing. The kids are cute too.

I am also a fan of these covers of the Ghostbusters' song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAFoAzRlDY0 , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdGwNHGP8TI .

Here are my thoughts. First of all, I dislike the fact that your school of fans is called "tiffanatics". As much as I love many of yuur works, I am trying to be a critical and non-fanatic fan. In fact, I encourage people

Hi all! With regards to my problem running X.org DEs/WMs from gdm (on fedora41): I found a workaround. Xephyr on GNOME on wayland can run icewm and respects hebrew-keymap.sh . Just letting you know.

Back when The Muppet Show ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppet_Show ) aired, it was joked that whenever it was airing was the perfect time to perform burglaries because the streets were empty. But naturally no burglar, whether self-respecting or not, would miss watching The Muppet Show.
