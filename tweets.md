Re spiderman, I recall having watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCl3ho6_gbg w @SarahMGellar & @jackblack before I watched the orig film (w @kirstendunst / etc.) found it funny. Then as I watched the orig, I said in my mind "now I know why that was funny."  several times.

This reddit post likely made Ms. Strong's twitter more popular. And good for her, because I'm a big fan of her.

I also have a hypothesis that, like it or not, here in the Selinaverse and shlomifverse, pleasure (and a possible precluding temporary pain), education, and creativity/conception are intertwined. While we can imagine realities where they arent, they'll be… different. https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/multiverse-cosmology-v0.4.x.asciidoc .

That's a fun and wonderful recording! thanks for sharing. The kids are cute too.

I am also a fan of these covers of the Ghostbusters' song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAFoAzRlDY0 , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdGwNHGP8TI .

According to TheCodex™ , ghosts are echoes of other organisms from other universes in Fantastecha™. For example, the Island of Lesbos was frequented by ghost ship cruises of lesbians, given it was the birthplace of Sappho. And there are also many comment on YouTube by usernames with 4-or-more 0-9 digits.

A marvelous event happened today. I discovered I was banned (possibly temply) from a freenode/libera chatroom , and I was relieved and happy. This is despite liking it a lot. Many years ago, someone on freenode had noted his girlfriend broke up with him, and he felt great, despite hading liked her

Wisely said, IMO. TheCodex™ notes that humour happens when a predicate P(from $start to $end ) evaluates to true for one path and as false for another. So, if you switch to the other path, the joke stays funny.
