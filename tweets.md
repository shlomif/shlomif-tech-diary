Re spiderman, I recall having watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCl3ho6_gbg w @SarahMGellar & @jackblack before I watched the orig film (w @kirstendunst / etc.) found it funny. Then as I watched the orig, I said in my mind "now I know why that was funny."  several times.

This reddit post likely made Ms. Strong's twitter more popular. And good for her, because I'm a big fan of her.

I also have a hypothesis that, like it or not, here in the Selinaverse and shlomifverse, pleasure (and a possible precluding temporary pain), education, and creativity/conception are intertwined. While we can imagine realities where they arent, they'll be… different. https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/multiverse-cosmology-v0.4.x.asciidoc .

One potential downside may have been that the Jennenses had to adopt additional family-names, given some vampires were under the impression they were foolishly wasting time+money.
