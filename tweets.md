Re spiderman, I recall having watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCl3ho6_gbg w @SarahMGellar & @jackblack before I watched the orig film (w @kirstendunst / etc.) found it


Re spiderman, I recall having watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCl3ho6_gbg w @SarahMGellar & @jackblack before I watched the orig film (w @kirstendunst / etc.) found it funny. Then as I watched the orig, I said in my mind "now I know why that was funny."  several times.

Perhaps I will be slain by all my children. Together, you are much more awesome than I am.

"Love/Knowledge" while important is not the be all and all

I like Dani Cimorelli so much, but I feel guilty thinking she is sexy. The reason is thatby 2001 her mother, discovered my sites and was impressed, and "raped me in her heart". There's nothing ppl can do about that and I don't want to.

Hi Wil! A little offtopic, but I started writing a new screenplay starring you as a fictionalised you (not unlike TBBT) - https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/The-10th-Muse/The-10th-Muse--Athena-Gets-Laid.html . Crossover / comedy / parody , and CC-by-nc-sa .

Hi all! my favourite balloon animal is a cat ;). My name is Shlomi Fish, and I'm 1977-born, cis&mostly-straight male, secular pluralist&universalist of Jewish descent who lives in Tel Aviv. I have been classed as an enemy of some geek Feminist forums due to lack of tact, but see https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/are_you_a_sexist__are_you_a_feminist.xhtml . You can learn more about me from my FAQ: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/ .

"A vampire can only be slain by other vampires, except for the last standing vampire who will be slain by his favourite children." — The-Codex™ of The-Game™.

"Yoda: Matters not Sith [= wizard] number, as much as short-term quarterly gains."

The point is that "being slain" / ascension / Catharsis is a team effort. i'm the last vamp partly coz I preferred to err on naivity than on cynicism.

Most cars in my neighbourhood used to not stop for letting pedestrians cross. Then i started waving2thank those that did, like what i saw at Scotland. Now mostofthem stop. Positive feedback often does work.

Like it or not, in the Selinaverse and shlomifverse, pleasure (and a possible precluding temp pain), education, and creativity/conception are intertwined. While we can imagine realities where they arent, theyll be… different. https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/multiverse-cosmology-v0.4.x.asciidoc .

This reddit post likely made Ms. Strong's twitter more popular. And good for her, because I'm a big fan of her.

I also have a hypothesis that, like it or not, here in the Selinaverse and shlomifverse, pleasure (and a possible precluding temporary pain), education, and creativity/conception are intertwined. While we can imagine realities where they arent, they'll be… different. https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/multiverse-cosmology-v0.4.x.asciidoc . While I do not encourage adults to try to "4th-base" 3 years olds in reallife, I cannot expect children not to learn or have fun either. And that implies they'll have conceptual/sexual experiences.

I gave some ppl who were walking a toddler my card which reads "humorist, writer, and software geek" [ https://www.shlomifish.org/me/business-card/ ]. One of them told me "you don't look like a geek".

I suspect the reason that Christina's introes/outroes had so many videos' interruptions is that they were lying to me: https://www.shlomifish.org/art/recommendations/music/online-artists/fan-pages/chris-grimmie/ . Occam's Razor tells me there *is* a conspiracy.

Hi all. After tweaking https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/teaser/ [orig] into https://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/teaser/ [deriv], then div.story 's lower edge is wrong (after pressing 'play'), and its height does not encompass the whole height of the viewport. How to fix?

I've been thinking that my last name, "Fish" cud imply: 1] "plenty of fish" - pluralism and tolerance. 2] progressing carefully, but steadily, like a timid little fish. 3] "fishy" - weird/strange.

I think I kinda fit all-of-these.
