Hi!

I hope I'm not being considered too domineering and meddling in other people's affairs, but:

1. I encourage people to encourage others to criticise them ( http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/ ).

2. This is part of my "job" as "Messiah" / "hacker monarch" / "Pope" which is a role that I also encourage every man or woman, of any age to take: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gamedev--make-everyone--messiahs ; https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/ .

3. I care about the well being and happiness of everyone in the world.

I may be wrong, but request that you ponder my advice ( https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if--- ).

Anyway, judging by the video it seems that both Dani and the 5 other singers are unhappy - and even saddenned by her decision to leave.
