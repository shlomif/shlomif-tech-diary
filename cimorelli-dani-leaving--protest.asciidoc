Hi!

I hope I'm not being considered too domineering and meddling in other people's affairs, but:

1. I encourage people to encourage others to criticise them ( http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/ ).

2. This is part of my "job" as "Messiah" / "hacker monarch" / "Pope" which is a role that I also encourage every man or woman, of any age to take: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gamedev--make-everyone--messiahs ; https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/ .

3. I care about the well being and happiness of everyone in the world.

I may be wrong, but request that you ponder my advice ( https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if--- ).

Anyway, judging by the video it seems that Dani as well as the 5 other singers are unhappy - and even saddenned by her decision to leave. They cite the fact that being part of the band is too time consuming and interferes with her passion in Graphics design. But I don't see why it should be?

Like the David vs. Goliath story shows ( https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional ), one needs to "hack", bend the rules/guidelines, be resourceful, defy one's "fate", and use technology: both tangible but also intellectual one.

E.g: If Dani cannot go on tours, she can be filmed, recorded and displayed from the comfort of her home. Or if there are too many covers that you are interested in producing, then either pick up ones based on auctions ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJrqpR_7VSo ) or roll dice.
