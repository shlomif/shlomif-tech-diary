Hi srlamb! Thanks for your response. Now here to the answers.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
I don't know if I can ping the host, because it doesn't normally answer to
pings, either.
</li>
<li>
I have <a href="http://freehackers.org/~shlomif/files/files/www.sf.org-conn-problem/">two
"good" and "bad" packet captures</a>, which I've recorded using Ethereal.
Hope it helps.
</li>
<li>
Regarding the hub - I'll need to get a hub first. At the moment all
I have is a small switch.
</li>
<li>
Regarding the last packet - see my Ethereal dumps.
</li>
<li>
I haven't tried UDP, but I don't think there's a UDP service running on the
host. I can try asking my hostmaster to run a simple UDP server there.
</li>
<li>
Regarding iptables:<br />
<pre>
[root@telaviv1 ~]# iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
</pre>
</li>
<li>
What is Explicit Congestion Notification?
</li>
<li>
I haven't tried "going straight to the Internet". I'm connected vis ADSL
and PPPoE. In any case, I don't think I can connect my computer to the Internet
this way for long enough in order to exhibit the problem, without neutralising
the Internet usage of the rest of my household.
</li>
<li>
I haven't tried upgrading the NAT box's firmware. However, now that I checked
<a href="http://www.sweex.com/producten.php?sectie=&amp;subsectie=&amp;item=80&amp;artikel=892&amp;detail=d">there
don't seem to be any updates for it</a>, yet.

</ol>
