<h2>2011-01-02: Report on the Tel Aviv Perl Mongers Meeting</h2>

<p>
This is a report on the latest <a href="http://telaviv.pm.org/">Tel Aviv
Perl Mongers</a> meeting. During that day, I woke up relatively early (07:00
or so as far as I can recall), and did not go to bed before night time so I was
a little tired later on. Before the meeting, I spent some time trying to get
<a href="http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/">the game Aquaria</a>, which
I got as part of the 2nd Humble Indie Bundle  to work properly on my Linux
system, unsuccessfully. (A more recent update is that
<a href="http://bugzilla.icculus.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4865">someone
eventually helped me after I filed a bug report</a>, and now I am able to
play the game nicely.). This delayed me a little, and I left relatively late
to the meeting.
</p>

<p>
After I arrived to Shenkar, I met <a href="http://idkn.wordpress.com/">Ido</a>
and a friend of his, and guided them to the room, which was different than
the one where the Tel Aviv Open source used to meet. We met some people there,
including Sawyer and I decided to go to the nearest kiosk and buy some snacks.
I bought some chocolate chip cookies, Doritos and a chocolate and hazelnut
treat and returned with still a lot of time before the lectures started.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, other people arrived there, and we talked about how to get
more people to contribute, about making use of CPAN modules in projects
and about which versions of Perl are used in the enterprise. Then the talks
began.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/">Sawyer X</a>
gave an entertaining presentation titled "Why Perl?" with several jokes in
between that got the audience to burst into laughter. He mentioned
<a href="http://wiki.theory.org/YourLanguageSucks">this page titled
"Your language sucks"</a> where several of Perl 5's shortcomings are mentioned
(along with other languages), and concluded with bad things about Perl,
like the fact that it makes you lazy, and that you can't stand programming
in other languages. He also mentioned there several ways to start with Perl,
but I was disappointed that he did not mention
<a href="http://perl-begin.org/">the Perl Beginners' Site (Perl-Begin)</a>.
</p>

<p>
After that, <a href="http://szabgab.com/">Gabor</a> came and talked about
what's new in perl-5.10.x and perl-5.12.x. He covered most bases and then
when he got to perl-5.12.x's
<tt>while (my ($index, $value) = each(@array))</tt> I asked
him if there was also <tt>keys(@array)</tt> and he said he doesn't know.
Today I tried it out and there is indeed <tt>keys(@array)</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
shlomif:~$ perl -E 'my @a=(50 .. 60); say join(",",keys(@a));'
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
</pre>

<p>
There's also <tt>values(@array)</tt>, but it's likely the same as "@array".
There are many small and large improvements in perl-5.10.x and 5.12.x and he
mentioned that the perl5-porters are now switching to a yearly release cycle,
which will make improvements materialise in production more rapidly.
</p>

<p>
After that, Ilan did a round of introductions where every person introduced
themselves and said which languages or technologies they work with and
why they came to the meeting. It was entertaining.
</p>

<p>
Then came <a href="http://blog.woobling.org/">Yuval</a>'s presentation
about "immutable state for Perl". He spent a short time explaining what is
mutable state, and that if we want to create a modified object, we need
to clone it with different constructor arguments. He spent the rest of
the time touting some of the advantages of immutable state, like easier
distributed NoSQL storage due to lack of cache invalidation, and he described
how he handled a problem in KiokuDB by creating a buffer for it, and also
focused on a recent problem we had at my (and previously his) work for
<a href="http://reask.com/">Reask</a> where HTML::FormHandler misbehaved due
to modified state after reset, and we were unable to resolve it and had to
switch to a different form generator (HTML::FormFu).
</p>

<p>
Some people with whom I talked felt this presentation was a little bit
abstract and "floating in the air" and I tend to agree, but I still enjoyed
most of it.
</p>

<p>
I left shortly after that presentation because I was tired (as I had woken
up early that day) but based on
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/2010/12/yesterdays-telavivpm-meeting.html">Sawyer's
post</a>, some people went to dinner afterwards and had a good time. I walked
with <a href="http://www.mksoft.co.il/">mksoft</a> to the bus station
and talked about games in Linux and the Humble Indie Bundle 2 which we both
had bought. Then a suitable bus had arrived and I took it home.
</p>

<p>
To sum up, I had a great time, about 20 people came, which meant the meeting
was a success, and I'm looking forward for the future meetings. Meeting at
Ramat Gan is much more convenient for me than the Rehovot meetings and I met
some people I didn't see in Rehovot like
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~eilara/">Ran</a>, who also gave me some money
in exchange for the refreshments I bought (Thanks!). I'm looking forward for
the next meetings and thanks to all the people who had organised and publicised
it.
</p>

<h2>2010-12-16: Tel Aviv Perl Mongers Meeting on 26-January-2011</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://telaviv.pm.org/">Tel Aviv Perl Mongers</a> (part of
<a href="http://www.perl.org.il/">the Israeli Perl Mongers</a>) will meet on
Wednesday, 26-January-2011 at
<a href="http://www.shenkar.ac.il/home/">Shenkar College</a>,
Anna Frank 12, Ramat Gan, room 323. The gathering is going to be at 18:30 and
the talks will start at 19:00.
</p>

<p>
This meeting will try to focus on web development and will (as any meeting)
include both beginner talks and intermediate ones.
We will also start a tradition of exhibition! Module exhibition, that is.
Pick a module you want to exhibit and take 5 minutes to talk about it.
If you want to exhibit a module, you can talk to me privately (if you need a
laptop, or funny hats) or you can just step up in between talks.
</p>

<p>We are going to hear these talks:</p>

<p>
<b>What the hell is web development? (<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/">Sawyer X</a>)</b>
</p>

<p>
A nice, easy, hopefully interesting, understandable introduction to web
development.
</p>

<p>
<b>The web stack (Ilan Arad)</b>
</p>

<p>
A hands-on, discussion-oriented talk on advanced understanding of the web
stack, from server-side to client-side.
(advanced talk)
</p>

<p>
As always, there are a few good reasons to come to the Perl Mongers
meetings:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Meeting more geek-minded people like yourself</li>
<li>Learning new stuff, if you're a beginner</li>
<li>Learning new stuff, if you're advanced</li>
<li>Shlomi brings snacks!</li>
<li>Laughs, jokes, fun, and anything else we can fake! :)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please feel free (and do) invite anyone you want!
</p>

<h2>2011-01-29: Update and Recenty Hacktivity-ish Post</h2>

<p>
Well, I'm still alive and kicking, so I decided to put a small update about
what I have been up to.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I attended the <a href="http://worldtour.fogcreek.com/">FogBugz
and Kiln World Tour</a>, which I did in order to see
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel "on Software" Spolsky</a> speak,
and was otherwise a blast. In the second part, they gave several good reasons
for why Mercurial and git are better than Subversion, and the demo of
FogBugz was also instructive, but seems like it contains many features that
won't be useful in my daily work as an open-source developer. They also said
that the reasons they prefered Mercurial over git were because it had a
somewhat friendlier command names (which are more familiar to people coming
from Subversion and CVS) and because it worked better on Windows, and the git
people were hostile towards fixing the bugs that git exhibited on Windows.
Otherwise, they said that git was a fine distributed version control system.
</p>

<p>
I also attended the latest <a href="http://telaviv.pm.org/">Tel Aviv Perl
Mongers</a> meeting, which was nice, and this time stayed for the after-party
dinner. I'd like to give a more detailed report about it later.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to announce that, in case you have not heard about it,
<a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.6/">KDE 4.6.0 is out.</a>. It
has many big and small improvements, including some speed boosts, and runs
like a dream on my Mandriva Linux Cooker system (though Amarok got broken
with the upgrade to MySQL-5.5.x). Here is also
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/24333/KDE_4_6_0_Released">the
OSNews.com coverage</a> and
<a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/11/01/27/2327228/KDE-Software-Compilation-460-Released">Slashdot.org
coverage</a>). I should also note that I've recently downloaded and installed
the Amarok 2.x for Windows distribution and it ran very fine there, but
as opposed to Linux could not play the video files I tried at all.
</p>

<p>
After some length attempts to contact the originator of the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Format/">Text-Format CPAN module</a>,
I was finally given a comaint status and I uploaded Text-Format-0.53 to
CPAN, its first release since 1998, and the first one that contains a dash
before the version digits (a small difference, but it confuses some packaging
systems). There's still some work to do there, but I haven't forgotten it.
</p>

<p>
Also in CPAN-land, I've uploaded a new version of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Config-IniFiles/">Config-IniFiles</a>,
which contains a patch I applied from Peter Xu, who asked me to be his mentor
in his first steps in contributing to open-source. I've expressed my
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/mentoring/">willingness
to be a FOSS mentor</a> for some time now and several people contacted
me about it, but this is the first time that a code contribution came out of
it, and I'm happy with Peter's patch. I guess good things come to those who
wait.
</p>

<p>
I've recently started reading
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530">Kent Beck's "Test Driven Development: By Example"</a>, which I can recommend
so far, and also been working on some other open-source projects which I'd
rather not tell too much about now.
</p>

<p>
Hope you are also doing fine, wherever you are and happy hacking.
</p>

<h2>2011-02-08: Solving "ABC Path" Using Perl</h2>

<p>
Recently, I haven't been blogging too much, but instead focusing more on
writing code as well as other Internet mediums such as IRC (Internet Relay
Chat), Instant Messaging, and E-mail/mailing lists. But what good is your
code if no one knows about it? So here is a blog post about a recent complete
project for <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/japanese-puzzle-games/abc-path/">solving the game ABC-Path</a> by Otto Janko
as <a href="http://www.brainbashers.com/abcpath.asp">featured
on BrainBashers.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
ABC Path is a single-player riddle-game, played on a 5*5 grid where one square
is filled with one of the letters (usually A). For each of the rows, columns
and the two diagonals, one is given two letters out
of the 25 letters from A to Y, asclues. Either letter
can be anywhere in the 5 given places, but you know
that letters that are adjacent in the alphabet are adjacent either
horizontally, diagonally or vertically.
</p>

<p>
I've played a few games and enjoyed them, and then decided to write a solver
for ABC Path in Perl. The method I used was similar to that used in solving the
so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_puzzle">logic puzzles</a>
where one is given a grid where one can mark a square matching a column
or a row as either "true/yes", "false/no" or "unknown". This is with some
natural conclusions such as a "yes" implying the other squares in the column
and row are "no"s, and that if a row or column has all squares but one as
"no", then the remaining (unknown) square must be a "yes".
</p>

<p>
So what I did was construct a large grid in the memory which contains all cells
(all 25 of the cells in the 5*5 grid of ABC Path grid - which are all
aggregated into the column of one of the truth-table grids, a little confusing
I know), and matches it against the 25 letters with yes/know/unknown verdicts.
Then the program filters according the clues, and then it gradually makes
deductions based on proximities of nearby letters until a verdict is reached.
</p>

<p>
Now, when I coded the first version it used one global variable for the
grid (which was implemented as a giant binary string while using
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/vec.html">perl's vec</a> for
handling individual [$letter, $x, $y] 2-bit "yes/no/unknown" states.
This was done with some global subroutines that operated on it. However, then
I discovered that sometimes I was still left with some permutations of
letters that could be in several state without an ability to find out what
is conclusive without assigning them recursively.
</p>

<p>
As a result, I changed my program to use an object for the state variable,
where after a lot of work, I was able to recurse into the individual
combinations and see which ones yield a successful
assignment (naturally and hopefully - one and only one, as the solution
is supposed to be unique). This is a case of
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/chapter1/node13.html">tree recursion</a>,
but I believe very deep recursion depth would be relatively rare with most
combinations of initial hints.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I was then able to solve all the ABC Path puzzles I tried
from BrainBashers.com , but naturally, it required some work to make it
ready for CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) and then I had to
release some new releases fixing some problems with the documentation that
I've consciously avoided addressing in the first releases.
</p>

<p>
OK, enough verbiage, now let's see a live demonstration (right now as a shell
transcript, but I'd like to make a screencast too in time):

<p>
We did it!
</p>

<p>
Now for some future directions: I've been thinking of some ways to automatically
construct layouts of ABC Path that a human can solve, while using this solver
to make sure the solutions are unique. I believe that we need to use a
random number generators with one seed per problem.
</p>

<p>
So what does the future hold? I have began work on several other solvers in
various levels of completion for some of <a
href="http://www.brainbashers.com/logicpuzzles.asp?sudoku=Y">the
other Japanese-style riddle-games</a>, and have been wondering if one can write
a solver for all of them similar to the approach taken by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Game_Playing">General Game
Playing</a> Artificial Intelligence approach (although I suspect that that
may completely kill performance).
</p>

<p>
Well, if you'd like to contribute, then the code is
<a href="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/fc-solve/abc-path/">here</a>. I
realise Subversion is old school (for some values of old) and that there are
shinier fashions around, but I should be able to copy with git and Mercurial
clones of the mini-repository.
</p>

<p>
I introduced someone to ABC Path on #perlcafe, and he said he enjoyed playing
a few games, and there are many others daily ones on BrainBashers.com and
elsewhere. It's not just Sudoku, you know. Happy playing!

<h2>2011-03-08: Finished Projects, Maintained Projects and Those that are Up For Adoption</h2>

<p>
This is another boring braindump.
</p>

<p>
First of all, let me point you in the direction of <a href="http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/">my shiny new blog</a> titled
"Unarmed but Still Dangerous" and subtitled "Changing the world
one post at a time". It is a blog of essays and possibly also
insightful fiction (we'll see), from a programming enthusiast
(so-called software "hacker") intended for programming enthusiasts, not
necessarily focusing on computing topics, but kinda assumes being somewhat
tech-savvy or
knowledgeable about technology. I successfully Slashdotted
<a href="http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/909.html">the
first real post</a> about coping with provocative people on the Internet
using the "Verbal Judo" technique from the book "Feeling Good" by
David Burns (and also tried to digg it with less success), and from there it
hit many other news sites, blogs, microblogs, and forums, until someone asked
me if I announced it on every possible news sites (which I didn't). Other
people have told me on IM or IRC and elsewhere that they've heard about it and
either liked it and/or had some reservations from it.
</p>

<p>
I used the shop-worn
<b>Perl vs. Python debate</b> as a test case there (though
maybe it was a bit too geeky), which I think added to the humour of the post.
</p>

<p>
I got some comments there (some of them were ironically provocative), and I
enjoyed the attention. I think publishing the post and Slashdotting it
actually made me a bit calmer, because I was anxious to already do it. I hope
this post gets more geeks interested in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Therapy-Revised-Updated/dp/0380810336">"Feeling
Good"</a> and in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">Cognitive
Therapy</a> in general, which I found to be very insightful and helpful and
useful in avoiding or dealing with many frustrations.
</p>

<p>
I still plan on keeping the more technical (and thus more dry) discussion
on "shlomif-tech". (At least until I find or get a better venue).
</p>

<p>
<b>Back to the topic</b>: some days ago I was chatting on Freenode when
someone asked me that:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Shlomi, have you completed your [Freecell] solver at last? ;)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He may have said it tongue-in-cheek, but I'd like to answer it seriously. The
way I see it there are several kinds of projects as far as their "hacktivity"
status is concerned. Some of them are actively maintained and enhanced,
possibly by many members. Some of them still have a maintainer, but are in
"deep maintenance mode". Some of them just accumulate bug reports and
feature requests without someone to adopt them. Some of them are dead
and no one cares too much about, because people have mostly used other
programs instead.
</p>

<p>
In the case of <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">my Freecell solver</a>,
it's a bit more complicated. I haven't completely lost interest in working
on it, and there's still a lot of room for improvement, but I often feel
like I have better things to do than to work on it, because it is already good
enough for most of my needs and the needs of most other people. So far my
attempts at finding an enthusiastic co-developer (or even primary developer)
for it failed to a large extent, though some of the people who attempted
to contribute, proved to have contributed to the project's success to an
extent as well. Freecell may also be losing some popularity among the younger
generation, in part because Microsoft now includes many other games in its
operating systems (which is overall a good thing, because shipping an
operating system with only four built-in games is a joke.). While a lot of
the older people I told about the fact that I've authored a solver for
Freecell (including some attractive girls), were impressed by it, I think
most of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y">youngsters</a>
are not too excited about Freecell, despite the fact that Freecell solving
is very interesting from the computer science, software engineering and
artificial intelligence point-of-view.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, I've been getting the feeling that many of the relatively small-scoped
projects I've started and released as open-source, are only used by me.
An example for that may be
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/">XML-Grammar-Fiction</a>,
in which I've recently found some stupid bugs, and, which, while some people
may find interesting, only addresses a very small niche. There is some advantage
to releasing a program as "shrinkwrap", but I guess it's not what people always
want. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> and
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat.net</a> appear to have quite
a lot of similar software, which many people don't use.
</p>

<p>
Now, I have some projects which I've decided that I've lost interest or am
no longer qualified to do. One of them is
<a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/">the Better-SCM site</a> which proved
to host several popular resources, including its
<a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/comparison/">comparison</a>. Lately,
I've felt that I'm both under-qualified to maintain it, as well as lack the
interest to do so. If you'd like to volunteer to do it, give me a shout.
</p>

<p>
Regarding <a href="http://perl-begin.org/">Perl-Begin</a>, I'm still improving
it as I run into things there, but now think that in order to facilitate
contributions from other people, I'd like to convert its Subversion
repository to a distributed version control system (DVCS) - either git or
Mercurial (although I believe they both can interoperate pretty well) - and to
host it on Github, Gitorious, or
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket.org</a> where
it will be easier to collaborate on it. I personally find Mercurial more
intuitive and faster and more flawless to work with, but most Perl people and
programmers in general appear to prefer git and Github. I'll see about it.
</p>

<p>
Another project is the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Graph-Easy/">Graph-Easy CPAN module</a>.
The problem with it is that I lack the tuits and the competency to maintain
it, and it keeps accumulating bugs and bug comments (many of them are real)
without me being able to do anything about it. I've became a co-maintainer
for it because I used it in one of my projects, and am no longer actively
interested in it, and find it intimidating.
</p>

<p>
Most of my other software projects are either in deep maintenance mode, in
planning/dreaming stages, were not released yet or still have room for
improvement, but too little motivation and the fact I don't have an immediate
use for these features and no one asked for them. Maybe I should look at
contributing to some projects with many other people there such as
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>, which I've contributed to in the
past and could use a lot of work (though its main problem is the hostility
of some of the core developers).
</p>

<p>
In the "Cathedral and the Bazaar", which set forth the case for the "Bazaar
model" of open source development, Eric S. Raymond mentions the story of how
he came to adopt what later would become fetchmail:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But Carl Harris's attitude was even more important. He understood that
</p>

<p>
5. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off
to a competent successor.
</p>

<p>
Without ever having to discuss it, Carl and I knew we had a common goal of
having the best solution out there. The only question for either of us was
whether I could establish that I was a safe pair of hands. Once I did that, he
acted with grace and dispatch. I hope I will do as well when it comes my turn.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Raymond continued to improve and maintain "popclient→Fetchmail" for a long
time, before and after he has written "the Cathedral and the Bazaar", but
ended up passing its active maintenance to different maintainers. This is
indicative of hacking maturity on Raymond's role. I hope to follow
his lead when the day come for me to pass the ongoing maintenance of the
various projects I maintain, even those that I've written extensively about
(such as <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/docs/">the various essays</a>
I've written about Freecell Solver) or brought me a significant amount
of esteem, fame, and/or recognition. I hope you will too, one day.

<h2>2011-04-08: Speeding Up Bulk SQLite Inserts</h2>

<p>
This is a tip on how to speed up bulk inserts in
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>. In case, you don't know
SQLite is an SQL database implemented as a small, yet very fast library,
which, accesses everything from the file-system. Furthermore, it is open-source,
public domain, and reliable.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I wanted to create a server-side script to individually display my
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">fortune cookie quotes</a>
- each on its own page based on its ID. In order to speed up the lookup, I
decided to store everything in a
<a href="http://perl-begin.org/uses/databases/">database</a>, be it
the raw file-system, something like Berkeley DB or Tokyo Cabinet, or an
SQL-based database. I ended up using SQLite, which worked pretty well.
</p>

<p>
I've written a program to populate the database by parsing the data from
the XML source files and extracted the data from there. I prepared an INSERT
statement:
</p>

<pre>
my $insert_sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&lt;&lt;'EOF');
INSERT INTO fortune_cookies (collection_id, str_id, title, text)
VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)
EOF
</pre>

<p>
(It started a bit simpler, but that's what I have now.)
</p>

<p>
And then I executed it for each record. It took a lot of time to complete -
many minutes. So I consulted <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl">#perl</a>
about it and got a few suggestions:
</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
That I should disable the so-called “shared database” mode, which is the
default SQLite mode that assumes other processes on the machine might
access the database.
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
That I should turn off Autocommit and commit in batches with more than
one record in each in every transaction.
</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p>
The number two option seemed the most likely, and I tried commiting in batches
of 50 records each and it made the populating program finish in a few seconds.
So I was very happy.
</p>

<p>
I guess I can try the shared database mode later on, since I populate the
database offline. Now the program for displaying every quote individually is
working nicely, and I am very happy. Thanks to the #perl people for helping
me again.
</p>

<div class="entry" id="your-programming-language-must-suck">

<!-- Tags: perl, programming, languages
-->

<h2>2011-04-13: Your Programming Language Must Suck</h2>

<p>
All languages of the world suck. If you require people to declare variables
(like in Pascal, C, <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Scheme</a>
or Perl 5 with <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/strict.html">strict</a>), then
people will tell you they like variables to spring up upon first use. Without
variable declarations, then you get various weird side-effects of the implicit
scoping. If you use curly braces for scoping, then you'll have to type more and
there's more clutter. With indentation-based scoping (like in Python), you'll
find it hard to introduce multiple-expression <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#First-class_functions">lambdas</a>.
</p>

<p>
Rob Pike and Paul Graham hated object oriented programming (OOP) and so they
didn't introduce it in their <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29">"Go"</a>
and <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_%28programming_language%29">"Arc"</a>
languages, well after OOP has become mainstream. And guess what? Many people,
including me, think that OOP is still a good thing (and no, in my opinion, C++
did not do OOP very well) and so gave up on Arc quickly and did not look
closely at Go. Many people who oppose OOP claim that it mashes together many
separate feature, such as typing, capability of being instantiated,
and polymorphism which belong as separate features in the language, but
naturally it <b>is</b> convenient to have them integrated as one, because
they are often useful together.
</p>

<p>
Dynamically typed languages (like Perl 5, Python, Ruby, or Lisp) possibly
suffer from many subtle errors&#160;; Statically typed languages (like Haskell)
are less expressive and it seems that about one third of the language design
papers published on <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the
    Ultimate</a> are about various funky extensions to the Haskell type system
to allow for better expressiveness.
</p>

<p>Purely functional languages have no
assignment and most people find them harder, in part because the world around
us has a lot of state, and they also need to do funky compiler tricks to make
you feel like you don't need assignment. Non-functional languages have
side-effects and so are prone to many errors.</p>

<p>If you have goto or
goto-like statements (such as exceptions or Perl 5's "last LABEL;" (more like
"break" in C) or "next LABEL;"), then you encourage code to not be factored
correctly. If you don't have such stuff, then programmers will hate you for
having to go through many hoops to write quick-and-dirty code.</p>

<p>Perl 5
has a dedicated regular expression syntax which is treated magically by the
parser. PHP and Java use strings for them, and require weird escaping and
backslashing rules to interpolate the sub-regexes inside them. And if you
incorporate a first-order syntax for regular expressions, then people will want
similar first-order syntaxes for XPath, for XML (like some recent versions of
Visual Basic .NET have), and for all other grammars you may need to embed.</p>

<p>Finally, many people absolutely hate all the clutter created by the leading
<a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28computer_programming%29">sigils</a>
of Perl 5 (the "$", "@", etc.), and similar languages, but they allow for much
better backward compatibility, facilitate the so-called "interpolation" (=
embedding inside strings), and also give some important visual cues when
skimming code (even without syntax highlighting).</p>

<p><b>You are damned either way</b>, whatever you do.</p>

<p>I could have gone
on, but I think I got my message across. Thing is, when designing a programming
language, you need to make a lot of design decisions - what to include, what to
exclude, etc. However, many of these design decisions are not 100% advantages
or 100% disadvantages, but in fact trade-offs, and many people will question
them and be unhappy. You can never please all the people. So make a design
decision, and stick with it, and realise that <b>your programming language must
    suck</b>, but that it may suck less for some tasks, or for some people.</p>

<p>Joel on Software <a
    href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/15.html">refers</a> to
the book <a
    href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400040507/joelonsoftware/ref=nosim"><i>Small
        Things Considered: Why There Is No Perfect Design</i></a>, which I have
not read, but I've concluded it holds for programming language design.
Moreover, even when writing code, we run into many trade-offs. For example, if
our methods or functions are very short, then they are easier to over-ride and
re-use, but, in that case, the code would be harder to follow and will perform
worse than code with longer methods.</p>

<h2>2011-04-16: Tech Tip: Caching the XHTML DTDs</h2>

<p>
Some days ago I needed to speed up validating an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML">XHTML</a> document (the module
XHTML 1.1) based on the DTDs provided by the W3C, so I sought a way
to cache them on the disk. Problem is I could not effectively download them
from the W3C because their download speed was throttled.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, <a href="http://www.gentoo-wiki.info/HOWTO_W3C_Validator">the
Gentoo Wiki's “W3C Validator HOWTO” document</a> provided some insights. Just
download
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib.tar.gz">http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib.tar.gz</a>,
unpack it, cd to its directory and do
<tt>export XML_CATALOG_FILES="$(pwd)/catalog.xml"</tt> to set the XML
catalogue appropriately. It's too bad I could not find a Mandriva Linux
package for that.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, after I did that, the validation and other XML processing worked
nicely.

<h2>2011-05-18: Tech Tip: Displaying Hebrew/Arabic/etc. Right-aligned in Kate</h2>

<p>
By default, the <a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate
editor of the KDE project</a> displays Hebrew/Arabic text etc. left aligned
in the window instead of aligned to the right edge of the window even after
the "Enhanced support for languages written right-to-left" is
checked in the <tt>qtconfig</tt> applet. To remedy this you need to
enable in the settings “Appearance → General → Dynamic Word Wrap” and
after doing that the mostly Hebrew lines will be properly aligned.
</p>

<p>
(I don't know why the “Dynamic Word Wrap” should affect that, and it took
a long time to realise this was the problem due to the web searches and the
KDE developers on IRC being ignorant, but that seems to be the solution to
this.)

<h2>2011-06-16: Tech Tip: KDE 4: Changing the Names of the Virtual Desktops from the Command Line</h2>

<p>
I've written
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/kde4-virtual-desktop-names">a small
command-line utility</a> to change the names of the KDE 4
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop">virtual desktops</a>
(also known as "virtual workspaces").
</p>

<p>
To use it, do something like this:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
./set_kde4_virtual_desktop_names \
    "Main" "Devel" "Chat" "Donkey" \
    "Music" "Config" "Workspace 7" "Games"
</pre>

<p>
I've originally thought I could do it by setting the value of
<tt>_NET_DESKTOP_NAMES</tt> in xprop, but that turned out to be futile. Then
I decided that imitation was the sincerest form of flattery and ripped the
relevant code out of kdebase-workspace, and after some modifications, it
worked. I'd like to thank <tt>pinotree</tt> from <tt>#kde-devel</tt> for
some assistance.
</p>

<p>
Here is the code, but the repository also contains a
<tt>CMakeLists.txt</tt> file:

    // set desktop names
    for( int i = 1; i &lt;= numDesktops; i++ )
    {
        QString desktopName = desktopNames[ i -1 ];
        info.setDesktopName( i, desktopName.toUtf8());
        info.activate();
    }
    // set number of desktops
    info.setNumberOfDesktops( numDesktops );
    info.activate();

    XSync(QX11Info::display(), false);
#endif

    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Hope you like it. The reason I've written it is because the names of the
virtual desktops got reset for me in KDE 4 and I didn't want to set them
times and again.

<h2>2011-06-16: Causing an Error in code.google.com</h2>

<p>
One time when trying to do something with code.google.com, I got a server
error. I recorded the HTTP session that led to it and converted it to a
self-reproducing Perl script, which still gives me this error. I reported
this error to Google on the relevant forums twice, but I did not get a reply.
So in the name of

I'm reporting it here.

The script in question can be found

<h2>2011-06-16: More Vim Tips</h2>

<p>
Here are some more <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> tips I collected
recently:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
One can repeat the last <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/33453.html">t,
f, T or F command</a> which moves to the next specified character in a line, or
right before that, using
<a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#;">;</a>, and repeat
in the opposite direction using
<a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#,">,</a>. I
discovered those after starting to read through the vim <tt>usr_*</tt>
manuals.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
One can get the Unicode value of the character under the cursor using the
<tt>:ascii</tt> command-line command or the <tt>ga</tt> normal mode command.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If you want to find how many lines/words/etc. are in a visual block, you can
select it using "v" and friends and then type <tt>g-Ctrl+G</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Finally, you can pipe the contents of the buffer or a range to an external
program and view its output temporarily. So you can say
<tt>:w !grep 'FOO' | wc -l</tt> to find the number of lines containing 'FOO',
or <tt>:'a,'bw !grep 'FOO' | wc -l</tt> within a range.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
I should note that one thing that annoyed me lately, is the fact that after I
have a visual selection (<tt>v</tt> or <tt>V</tt>), I sometimes press
<tt>u</tt> instead of <tt>y</tt> (because they are so nearby) and so cause
the selection to become lowercase instead of yanking it.
</p>

<p>
Happy Vimming!

<h2>2011-07-22: Tech tip: killing all processes of a certain UNIX user.</h2>

<p>
In order to send a signal (such as kill) to all process of a certain UNIX
user, one can do:
</p>

<pre>
pkill -U "$username"
</pre>

<p>
To kill them forcibly using the 9 signal ("SIGKILL"), you can do:
</p>

<pre>
pkill -9 -U "$username"
</pre>

<p>
To just list their process IDs, you can do:
</p>

<pre>
pgrep -U "$username"
</pre>

<h3>Personal Log</h3>

<p>
svn.berlios.de has
<a
href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=18269&amp;group_id=1">not
been available in the past day</a> , which really drives me mad, so I decided
to:
</p>

<ol>

<li>Do stuff that don't require it, like blog or work on non-svn.berlios.de code.</li>

<li>Transition most of my code away from svn.berlios.de to bitbucket.org and
Mercurial once it is up.</li>

Kernel development, many free software libraries and programs and many
organizations alike. I intend to teach it to you. (Sawyer - 40 minutes).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Gitflow</b> - Gitflow is a useful wrapper tool to allow you to set a more streamlined
development process, taking into account features, releases, hot fixes and
more. It's very useful when using multiple developers with an integrator, a
QA, a dev team, and so on. I intend to showcase it as well! (Sawyer - 40 minutes.)

<h2>2011-09-05: Recommendation and Tip: The QUnit JavaScript Automated Tests Library</h2>

<p>
I've begun working on a JavaScript port of some algorithmic perl code, to allow
it to run inside a browser. As a result, I had to find a good JavaScript
automated tests library to allow me to write automated tests for the code. I
first looked at Test.More and Test.Harness from JSAN (the JavaScript Archive
Network) but as it turned out, JSAN was defunct, and no one had time to mark
it as such. Then I asked the “Test.Run” developer (another thing I had
found on jsan) to instruct me how to get it
up and running, and he gave me a link to its archive, which was 1.5 mb
compressed (!), and so was not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
I looked at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_unit_testing_frameworks#javascript">the
Wikipedia list of unit testing frameworks</a>, but there were too many. at least
I understood that jsUnit was no longer actively maintained. I looked at Jasmine,
which is a bdd framework for JS, but its syntax seemed too horrid and unnatural.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I decided to ask for recommendation on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack
Overflow</a> and, as after I wrote my title, I found a
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/96066/automated-unit-testing-with-javascript">a previous question</a>, where there was a recommendation of
<a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit">QUnit</a>, which I noticed was developed
by the jQuery people, and as I'm fond of jQuery, I decided to look deeper into
it.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't disappointed by QUnit - it does what it does well, and I was
able to write my test suite using it, so I can recommend it as well. It has
primitives that are very similar to perl's
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::More">Test::More</a>, and it can
even assert that the number of assertions ran within a test are right (like
Test::More can).
</p>

<p>
So here's a tip for it: if you're writing your testing code in a different
file, and you wish to check that no compile-time or run-time exception
was thrown (which will cause qunit to report a success with zero assertions)
you should wrap the testing code in a <tt>try { .. } catch</tt> block and in
the catch block, run <tt>ok(false...)</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example from my code:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;
                    &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;ABCPath Test&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;jquery-latest.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;qunit.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot; /&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;qunit.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;abc-path.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;abc-path-test.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
      $(document).ready(function () {
          try {
              test_abc_path();
          }
          catch (err) {
            module(&quot;Meta&quot;);
            test(&quot;global_failure&quot;, function() {
                ok (false, &#39;test_abc_path() has thrown an exception or is invalid.&#39;);
            });
          }
          // Hide passed tests by default.
          $(&#39;#qunit-tests&#39;).addClass(&#39;hidepass&#39;);
      });
  &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1 id=&quot;qunit-header&quot;&gt;QUnit example&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;h2 id=&quot;qunit-banner&quot;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

<h2>2011-09-29: New Computer</h2>

<p>
First of all, happy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah">new Jewish Year</a>.
</p>

<p>
My old Pentium 4 2.4 GHz computer (here's <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/person/shlomif/diary/176.html">the blog
entry where I blogged about getting it back in 22-September-2003</a>) has
served me mostly well for 8 years, but recently exhibited many signs of dying
and had problems booting a lot of the partitions there. As a result, we
bought a new computer to replace it: a Core i3 machine with 8 GB of RAM, a
2 TB hard-disk, and an Intel HD Graphics adapter. I've installed Mageia 1
on it and set it up, and it is now working mostly nicely.
</p>

<p>
I've ran into a few problems with it. From the 1280*1024 screen
resolution not working (which required adding a mode line), to
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg61605.html">packets
being dropped by the network interface</a> (which I found a fix for
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=713315">on
a Red Hat bug</a>), to the fact that
<a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37629">transparency is
not working properly</a> when running remote X apps (which is not resolved
yet.), but as a general rule - I'm happy.
</p>

<p>
The new computer is much faster than the old one, which wasn't too slow running
Linux either.

<h2>2011-12-13: Tech Tip: Removing Bash’s Command Completions</h2>

<p>
The normal way to remove a completion for a Bash command (say “mv”) is to do
“complete -r mv”. However, with the bash-completion package installed on
Mageia Linux Cauldron, this is not enough because it also adds a default
completion for every invoked command. So in order to override this behaviour,
type “complete -r -D” and then you can remove the commands’ completions
permanently, using “complete -r mv” or whatever.

עבור מספר פגישות לאחרונה.
</p>

<p>
ב-28 בדצמבר 2011 (יום רביעי) נערוך את מפגש הפרל החודשי שלנו, והפעם הוא יהיה
מיוחד!
אנו נפגשים ב-18:30 ומתחילים ב-19:00.
כתובת: מכללת שנקר, בניין ראשי ברחוב אנה פרנק, רמת גן, חדר 300.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
במפגש זה יהיו ההרצאות הבאות:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>ויזואליזציה של המוח של וים</b> - רן עילם -
אהבתם אותו ב"תשתיות לפיתוח משחקים בעזרת SDL, Moose ו-Coro", בכיתם בעקבות הביצוע
שלו במפגשים אחרי ההרצאות, ותעריצו אותו לחלוטין ב"ויזואליזציה של המוח של וים". האגדה
החיה רן עילם ירצה לנו (מתחילים ומומחים כאחד) על וים (Vim) ועל כיצד לעכל את החיה
הזאת. מילת אזהרה: שתי השורות הראשונות בקהל יפגעו מלהבות חוצבות כנגד אימקס (Emacs).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>צרור מודולים שהיה הגיוני לכתוב</b> - סוויר אקס:
אני הולך לסקור מספר מודולים לשימושי שכתבתי, מדוע הם נכתבו, ומתי הם שימושיים.
בסוף תצטרכו לשפוט אם היה זה בכלל כדאי לכתוב אותם. יהיו גם קלפיות של הצבעה!
(אנחנו נכסה את Algorithm::Diff::Callback, App::Genpass, Data::PowerSet::Hash
ו-Module::Version.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>לשדרג או לא לשדרג - פרל 5.6 כנגד פרל 5.14</b> - עידו קנר כנגד סוויר אקס:
מקור גדול של דאגה בקהילת משתמשי הפרל היא האם להשתמש בגרסה עדכנית של
פרל ואיזו גרסה צריכה להיחשב "ישנה מדי". מצד אחד, יש לנו את ההנהלה שרוצה
עד כמה שפחות עלות ושינויים (ולפעמים גם מנהלי המערכות רוצים בכך), ומצד שני
המפתח שרוצה להשתמש בטכנולוגיות החדשות ביותר, ופעמים רבות תקוע במערכות
שאבד עליהן כלח.
</p>
<p>
לאור שיקול רציני זה, אנו הולכים, איש בתורו, לתקוע מקל אחד בשני, כשאנו
חובשים כובעים מצחיקים, ולדון את הלא מאמינים והכופרים לגיהינום
עד שידגלו בצד אחד: 5.6 או 5.14!
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
המפגש הוא חינמי וכולם מוזמנים. נתראה שם!

<p>
<b>Please note the change of venue.</b> This is the building where we started
having TA.pm, and not the one which we used for some of the recent meetings.
</p>

<p>
On 28 December, 2011 (Wednesday), the Tel Aviv Perl Mongers will hold their
monthly meetup, and this time it is going to be special. We meet at 18:30 and the
talks begin at 19:00. The address is: Shenkar College, main building on Anna Frank street, Ramat Gan, Room 300.
</p>

<p>
One can find more details on
<a href="http://telaviv.pm.org/">the web-site</a> of
the Tel Aviv Perl mongers.
</p>

<p>
This meeting will hold the following talks:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Visualizing the brain of Vim</b> by Ran Eilam -
You loved him in "Game frameworks with SDL, Moose and Coro", you cried over
his performance in the after-meeting get-togethers, and you will absolutely
adore him in "Visualizing the brain of Vim". All-star legend Ran Eilam will
talk to us (both beginners and experts) about Vim and how to fathom this
incredible beast. I warn you, the first two lines in the audience will be
damaged by Emacs flames.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>A bunch of modules which made sense writing</b> - by Sawyer X:
I'm going to cover some utility modules I've written, why they were written
and when they are useful. At the end, you'll have to judge whether they were
worth writing at all.  There will be voting booths available!
(We'll cover Algorithm::Diff::Callback, App::Genpass, Data::PowerSet::Hash
and Module::Version.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>To upgrade or not to upgrade, Perl 5.6 vs. Perl 5.14</b> - ik vs. Sawyer X:
A source of great concern in the Perl users community is whether to use an
up-to-date Perl and what version should be considered "too old". On one
hand, we have the management that wants as little cost and changes as possible
(sometimes along with systems administrators), and on the other hand, the
developer who wants to use the latest technologies, and is often
stuck on obsolete systems.
</p>

<p>
In light of this serious consideration, we're going to take turns poking at
each other with a stick, wearing funny hats, damning the unbelievers and
heretics until they submit to one side: 5.6 or 5.14!
</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>
The entrance to the meeting is free-of-charge, and everyone are welcome to
attend. See you there!

<h2>2012-01-22: git tip: adding remotes to .git/config</h2>

<p>
When working with the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">git version control
system</a> and editing <tt>.git/config</tt> to add a new remote, some people
may be tempted to copy and change the <tt>origin</tt> remote that reads
something like:
</p>

<pre>
[remote "origin"]
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	url = git@github.com:shlomif/perl.git
</pre>

<p>
However, note that <tt>origin</tt> also appears at the <tt>fetch = </tt>
and needs to be changed there as well, or else all the branches will be placed
in <tt>remotes/origin</tt>. Maybe there's a better way to add a new remote
using the <tt>git config</tt> commands.
</p>

<p>
Other than that, I should note that there doesn't seem to be a consensus among
git users whether <tt>git pull --rebase</tt> is better than a simple
<tt>git pull</tt>: the perl people told me to use <tt>--rebase</tt> and the
Amarok people and someone on Freenode's <tt>##programming</tt> told
me not to use it. Now I'm just confused.

<h2>2012-02-18: Vim Tips: scp URLs, "set tabpagemax" and fixing C indentation</h2>

<p>
Here are some Vim tips I ran into recently. First of all, when opening
<tt>scp://</tt> URLs, one should use two slashes after the hostname instead of
1, like <tt>scp://hostname//home/myuser/foo.txt</tt> instead of
<tt>scp://hostname/home/myuser/foo.txt</tt>. I don’t know why that is the
case, but it does not work properly without it. It also seems that netrw
is buggy as it displays an irritating grey line on the cursor, the syntax
highlighting tends to be off and saving a file displays several lines at the
bottom.
</p>

<p>
Another tip is that gvim limits the number of tabs it opens when doing
<tt>gvim -p [file1] [file2] [file3]</tt>. As a result, it is possible that
not all files will be opened. If you want to change it you can set
<tt>set tabpagemax</tt> in your <tt>.vimrc</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I noticed that Vim c-indentation tends to indent parameters to
functions on subsequent lines using 8 spaces instead of 4 by default. I was
able to change it to 4, which is my preference by adding
<tt>set cinoptions+='(0,W4'</tt> to my <tt>.vimrc</tt>. There is plenty
of other nifty stuff available in the <tt>cinoptions</tt> parameter.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy!

<h2>2012-03-09: Tech Tip: Getting hgsubversion to Work with subversion-1.7.x</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Apache Subversion</a> version 1.7.x
broke some backwards compatible and some stuff got broken, including
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/HgSubversion">hgsubversion</a>,
which provides a way to use subversion remotes with Mercurial.
</p>

<p>
In order to fix it, just install <a
href="http://www.samba.org/~jelmer/subvertpy/">subvertpy</a>, which provides
alternative python bindings for subversion, which hgsubversion prefers by
default, and with which it works fine under subversion-1.7.x.
</p>

<p>
I discovered all that after I attempted to fix it the hard way by installing
subversion-1.6.x under /opt/svn-1.6.x, which required building an old
version of SWIG, and then setting <tt>PATH</tt>, <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>,
and <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt> and then having to remove the global python-svn
bindings from under <tt>/usr/lib</tt> (as root!) because hgsubversion did not
like them, a process which took me an entire evening and was frustrating and
was ridden with a lot of trial and error, so I would not recommend it.
</p>

<p>
Hope it helps. Also see <a href="https://bitbucket.org/durin42/hgsubversion/issue/316/hg-clone-file-fails-with-subversion-171-on#comment-1168456">this hgsubversion bug report</a>.

<h2>2012-04-15: ANNOUNCEMENT: Resumed maintenance of mikmod and libmikmod</h2>

<p>
To whom it may concern,
</p>

<p>
libmikmod is a portable and open-source (LGPLed) library for playing various
common formats of Module files, including MOD, S3M, XM, and IT. mikmod is a
Curses-based front-end for it, freely available under the GPL. Shlomi Fish would
like to announce that he resumed maintenance of libmikmod and mikmod, after many
years of lack of maintenance, after getting approval from
<a href="http://raphnet.net/">Raphaël Assénat (raphnet)</a>, the previous
maintainer.
</p>

<p>
So far, libmikmod-3.2.0-beta3 has been released with some older changes that
lingered in the old version control repository, as well as several important
fixes for security bugs taken from the downstream Mageia Linux package.
The version control repository was converted from CVS to Mercurial, and more
development is expected.
</p>

<p>
Plans for the future include releasing a stable libmikmod-3.2.0 and afterwards
converting the build system from GNU Autotools to CMake, and then looking into
fixing more bugs as they are encountered and implementing new features.
</p>

<p>
The old MikMod homepage ( <a href="http://mikmod.raphnet.net/">http://mikmod.raphnet.net/</a> ) now redirects to the new
one at
<a href="http://mikmod.shlomifish.org/">http://mikmod.shlomifish.org/</a>
where new development will take place
(some parts of it still need to be updated, but it should already be usable).
</p>

<p>
Any contribution including testing, reporting bug fixes, contributing changes
(as patches or as clones of the repository), or suggesting new features, will be
appreciated.
</p>

<p>
For more information about module files see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file">the wikipedia entry for
“Module file”</a>, and the

<h2>2012-04-23: New Vim Plugin: Add to Word Search</h2>

<p>
I’ve released a new plugin for the <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim
text editor</a>, called "add-to-word-search" (
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/add-to-word-search.vim">GitHub
repository</a>,
<a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=3955">Vim
Scripts page</a>), and I’d like to introduce it here. If you like Vim,
please let me know what you think by commenting below.
</p>

<p>
In order to properly introduce the plugin, one first should introduce the
different (and useful) commands of Vim of <tt>*</tt> and <tt>#</tt>. What they
do is search forward or backward for the complete word under the cursor (or
somewhat before it or after it). Bram Moolenaar (the creator of Vim)
covers them in his <a href="http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html">“Seven
habits of effective text editing”</a> document (there’s also a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX9m3g5J-XA">video</a> available),
and I think I covered them in a previous Vim tip.
</p>

<p>
Now, here is the use case that often bugged me: sometimes I searched for
a certain function, found it in the text and then found a function that called
this function (or often in the case of C code, a preprocessor macro that
wrapped it), and wanted to look for its occurrences <b>as well as</b> those
of the previous term. I wasn't aware of any good way to do it, so I ended up
writing the “add-to-word-search” plugin.
</p>

<p>
After installing it, and after having searched for a word using <tt>*</tt>
or <tt>#</tt>, one can press <tt>\**</tt> to search forward for an additional
word under the cursor (or <tt>\##</tt> to search backward), and then use it more
times to add additional words.
</p>

<p>
After publishing this plugin and mentioning it on
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#vim">#vim</a>,
“ironcamel” reported
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/add-to-word-search.vim/issues/1">an
issue</a> that it gives an error if you have <tt>set nowrapscan</tt>. I fixed
it, but was only able to do so by temporarily disabling <tt>nowrapscan</tt>,
and then enabling it if it was previously enabled. (Apparently, vimscript’s
exception-handling cannot handle some of the built-in errors.)
</p>

<p>
I also demonstrated it to my (now former) co-worker, who had been trying to
get used to Vim, and he said it looked useful, but asked if there was an easy
way to remove terms from the search query (which there is not at the moment),
and I noted it may be a good idea.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, this Vim plugin is open-source and available under the MIT/X11 licence.
Enjoy!

<h2>2012-05-27: Tech Tip: GNU tar’s “-a” Flag</h2>

<p>
On
<a href="https://www.mageia.org/pipermail/mageia-dev/2012-April/014266.html">this
post to the Mageia development mailing list</a> by Thierry Vignaud,
I discovered that GNU <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28file_format%29">tar</a> (at least in
recent versions) has an “-a” flag which is useful in conjunction with its
“-c” (create new archive) mode. This is because it detects the suitable
compression based on the extension and uses the appropriate flag.
</p>

<p>
So: “<tt>tar -cavf myarchive.tar.gz ./mydir/</tt>” is equivalent to
“<tt>tar -czvf myarchive.tar.gz ./mydir/</tt>”,
“<tt>tar -cavf myarchive.tar.bz2 ./mydir/</tt>” does the same thing
as “<tt>tar -cjvf myarchive.tar.bz2 ./mydir/</tt>” and so forth. When
unpacking archives, you can omit the “-a/-z/-j/-J” flags, because GNU tar
will detect the compression of the archive based on the file magic of the
compressed formats.
</p>

<p>
Another useful (and open-source) tool for manipulating tarballs and
other archives is
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/patool/">patool</a>, but I've been
meaning to suggest they do a short-circuiting when converting tarballs from
<tt>.tar.gz</tt> to <tt>.tar.xz</tt> to <tt>.tar.bz2</tt> / etc.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, enjoy.
</p>

<h3>Meta</h3>

<p>
I know I’ve been really negligent with blogging in
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/blogs/">my blogs</a> lately (which
is not good), but don’t worry - I am fine, just busy with a lot of stuff
including work work (which gives money but consumes time), doing quite a lot
of coding and other development on open-source software, some Freecell-related
research, keeping up with my E-mails, posting to mailing lists, playing some
computer games, chatting a lot (maybe too much) on the IRC, and naturally -
sleeping.
</p>

<p>
It seems that despite starting the new job in December, and despite the fact
that it was now spring time (which is often a time of calamity for me), I
did not have any particularly
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/hypomanias/">strong
periods of stress</a> lately, which is a good think. Thanks, $DEITY!
</p>

<p>
Today a friend who is an Israeli open-source enthusiast called me and asked me
why
I disappeared and if everything OK, and I replied, but he later called again
and said his mobile phone mixed me with someone else. Anyway, you can always
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/">reach me in many
ways</a>, but I think I should start blogging more often, so I‘ve picked up
this tech tip as the lowest hanging fruit.

<h2>2012-06-27: How to Listen to Jamendo Radio and Tracks from the Browser</h2>

<p>
In case you do not know, <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/">Jamendo</a> is
a show case for music licensed under Creative Commons licences, with a lot
of great tracks to listen to. However, after the recent upgrade, I found that
I was no longer able to listen to their radio stations or press the listen
button of their tracks using Firefox, my browser of choice.
</p>

<p>
Here is what I discovered on how to re-enable it after some investigation:
first of all, you need to enable and/or whitelist JavaScript for jamendo.com.
If you are using NoScript, you can use the “S” button on the Add-on bar for
that.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the new Jamendo requires Adobe Flash to be whitelisted as well.
If you are using
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashblock/">FlashBlock</a>,
then go to
“Tools → Add-Ons → Extensions → Flashblock → Preferences → Whitelist”
and add http://www.jamendo.com/ there. I don’t know how to properly enable
the listening on browsers and platforms which do not have Adobe Flash
installed, so blame Jamendo.com - not me. (And, yes, I know that
<a href="http://occupyflash.org/">Flash is evil</a>.)
</p>

<p>
There may be some other obstacles on the way, but now everything is working
fine for me. I am going to complain to Jamendo that in this HTML 5 day and
age, one needs to use Flash to listen to their streams, which, as I
recall, was not necessary in the old Jamendo.
</p>

<p>
Happy listening.

<h2>2012-06-27: Tech Tip: How to Build Firefox with Debugging Symbols on Linux</h2>

<p>
I spent a large part of today building Firefox on one of my Linux machines and
trying to figure out why
gdb did not display debugging symbols, and instead only displayed question
marks in the backtrace (<tt>??</tt> ). Eeventually, I found  a solution, so
I'd like to document the process for other people in the future.
</p>

<p>
The solution is documented
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=770900">in
this bug report that I filed</a> and involves the following steps:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Checkout the firefox source from the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/mozilla-central">mozilla-central
repository</a>
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Put something like the following in the <tt>.mozconfig</tt> file in the
source's root (where <tt>client.mk</tt> can be found):
</p>

<pre>
. $topsrcdir/browser/config/mozconfig
export LDFLAGS="-Wl,--no-keep-memory"
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/ff-dbg
ac_add_options --disable-optimize
ac_add_options --enable-debug
ac_add_options --enable-tests
ac_add_options --enable-debug-symbols
ac_add_options --prefix="$HOME/opt/firefox-from-hg"
</pre>

<p>
The important lines are the <tt>--enable-debug</tt>,
<tt>--enable-debug-symbols</tt> and the <tt>LDFLAGS one</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Type <tt>make -f client.mk</tt>. Now you'll need to wait.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Type <tt>make -f client.mk install PKG_SKIP_STRIP=1</tt> and make sure
you do not forget the <tt>PKG_SKIP_STRIP=1 parameter</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Now you can use <tt>gdb ~/opt/firefox-from-hg/bin/firefox</tt> to debug
Firefox with all the debugging symbols.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Enjoy!

<h2>2012-06-27: Getting Your Job Ad Replied To</h2>

<p>
Joel Spolsky had published an essay titled
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ResumeRead.html">“Getting
Your Résumé Read”</a> on his <i>Joel on Software</i> site, which gives very good
advice for job candidates
who want to apply for work. Today, I am going to cover the opposite direction:
give some advice for employers who publish job ads in hopes of finding
employees. I have seen my share of bad practises among the many job ads
I have read, and can tell which ones make me more willing to apply.
</p>

<p>
Before I start, I am going to share a small item, which I originally planned
to publish as is, and later decided to expand into this post, which I have
titled “The Worst Job Offer Ever”. After I wrote it, I thought that posting
something like that on my blog will make no one want to hire me ever again,
so don’t take it too seriously. I am not singling any particular “wanted”
adverts.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
I hope you agree that it is pretty bad. Now for the rest of the advice:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
The first thing you should do is to <b>spell the requirements precisely</b>.
What does the candidate must know for the job? Please consider avoiding
giving a number of years of experience because this is annoying. “1-3 years
of Java experience” — are people with 4 years of Java experience
underqualified?
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
You should also <b>give a precise description</b> of the job: something
like “Ruby-on-Rails expert”, “Perl expert”, “UNIX Systems Administrator”,
“PHP expert” etc. That way people who do not match this description will
know better than to apply.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
You should also use <b>proper spelling</b>, grammar, and syntax. Perl is not
spelled
<a href="http://perl-begin.org/learn/Perl-perl-but-not-PERL/">“PERL”</a>,
Python is not spelled “PYTHON”, and it's MySQL - not “MYSQL”, “Mysql” or
“mySQL”. It's also “PHP” - not “Php” or “php”.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If you have a successful business or planning on having one, then you should
get your own
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS domain</a>
such as <tt>mycompany.com</tt>, set up E-mail hosting for it, and send the job
posts from there. Sending
from a Webmail provider such as “@gmail.com”, “@hotmail.com” or “@yahoo.com”
will make a bad impression, and indicate lack of professionalism.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
You should also <b>use a standard desktop, or a comfortable laptop
computer</b> to type
and phrase the message - not a mobile device which results in more error-prone
and less
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_%28technology%29">Netiquette</a>
-conforming messages. Make sure that your E-mail lacks any of the branding
or advertising signatures such as “Sent from my iPhone”.
</p>
</li>


<li>
<p>
<b>Specify the formats</b> in which it is possible to send the résumé, for
example Microsoft Word, OpenDocument Text, XHTML or PDF. This way the
candidates will know which formats they should send and you will have less
problems reading their E-mails. That is one thing the worst job advert I
gave did right, but naturally many people will appreciate the ability to
send in different formats to the proprietary Microsoft Word format.
</p>

<p>
Also specify whether it would be possible to send a link to an online version
of the résumé for easy viewing using your favourite browser, and avoid the
hassles of opening attachments and their myriad formats.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Please don't require an “ability to work under pressure”. Most developers are
naturally going to perform worse under pressure, and you should make sure
you avoid pressuring them as much as possible. In order to attract developers,
it is a good idea to advertise
that your company normally operates on no more than 40 hours of work in
a week — see what Evan Robinson has written about it in
<a href="http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons">“Why
Crunch Modes Doesn’t Work: Six Lessons”</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you do have a pressured environment (which is unfortunate but a fact
of life), say “We have a pressured environment.” instead.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
Another good idea is to encourage candidates to show off their <b>open-source
projects</b> and web-presence (home sites, blogs, etc.). However, “show me
your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a> page” may
work for some people, but will leave a bad taste in the mouth, and will
offend some other people, because some people prefer some of its alternatives
(include me).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
You should spell <b>the location</b> of your offices (at least roughly) and
specify how much one can
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting">telecommute</a>, if at
all.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Whatever you do, please don’t post the job ad to the same forum more than
once every few months. Posting the exact same position several times will
make people annoyed and they may complain, filter your messages, or request
that you get banned from posting on the forum.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
It is a good idea to mention some of the <b>software management practices</b>
your
company employs, such as using version control, writing automated tests,
performing code reviews, refactoring, or pair programming.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Finally, as Joel mentions in the original essay, you should make your ad
<b>stand out</b>. One <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/israelrb/msg/29e6f84804a877f7?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain&amp;noredirect">good
example</a> was once posted to the Israeli Ruby developers mailing list:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Subject: Developers Developers Developers

Looking for developers who:

* want a full time, salaried position
* want to work in a fun, young workplace
* want to work in an environment that allows them to use (just about)
whatever tools they wish to get the job done
* know and love ruby
* ideally have experience with php and python
* want to work on large scale rails/merb projects that have nothing to
do with "the social web"
* want to drown a puppy every time they hear phrases like "the social
web"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This job ad (and especially the two last items) makes a stance, and makes
the readers feel empathic towards it.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Good luck!
</p>
</li>

<h2>2012-08-18: Tech Tip: debugging Ruby’s rspec scripts</h2>

<p>
This post will cover how to debug test scripts (and their equivlent
production code) of the Ruby programming language’s
<a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> framework using an interactive
debugger, which was a problem I've
ran into lately when working on some Ruby code. Most of the other posts I
found about the topic were either incomplete or out-of-date, but I got
some help from <tt>#ruby-lang</tt> on Freenode, so I was able to figure it
out.
</p>

<p>
What you should do is:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
install the <tt>ruby-debug</tt> gem: <tt>gem install ruby-debug</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Add <tt>require 'ruby-debug'</tt> to the top of the test script.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Add a <tt>debugger</tt> statement to lines where you want to place a
breakpoint. This is important because otherwise the debugger will never
stop. (I am unhappy with it.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Use the <tt>--debug</tt> flag in rspec:
<tt>rspec --debug t/parse-board.rb</tt>.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
After doing all that it worked for me, so now I'm happy.

<h2>2012-08-18: Bash Function for Caching Results</h2>

<p>
In this blog I’d like to blog about the newest edition to my
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29">Bash (the
UNIX shell)</a> aliases file: the <tt>cache()</tt> function. What it
does is cache the result of a lengthy command in a file in a common place,
and then simply output this file if it already exists. I found it of use
when I compiled a report which involved some lengthy recursive grep operations
which were time consuming, and required a lot of waiting. Another upside to
caching is the fact that one can monitor its progress by following the file
on disk.
</p>

<p>
Here is the cache function, available under the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT/X11 licence</a>:
</p>

<pre>
# What this function does is cache the result of a command in a file, and
# use the file to output the results in case it exists.
# Format is: cache "$basename_to_cache_in" $cmd $arg1 $arg2 $arg3...
cache()
{
    local cache_fn="$1"
    shift

    local dir="${CACHE_DIR:-.}"

    if ! test -d "$dir"; then
        mkdir -p "$dir"
    fi

    local fn="$dir/$cache_fn"
    if ! test -f "$fn" ; then
        "$@" &gt; "$fn"
    fi
    cat "$fn"
}
</pre>

Hope you find it useful.

<h2>2012-09-06: The Ultimate Irrational Homework Assignment</h2>

<p>
As someone who has been chatting on programming-related IRC (Internet
Relay Chat) for a while, I have witnessed my share of people coming up
with unreasonable needs due to homework. However, some days ago, someone
on <a href="http://perl-begin.org/FAQs/freenode-perl/">Freenode's #perl</a>
came and ask for help in parsing a semicolon that does not occur inside
shell quotes (e.g: <tt>echo "Semicolon in string - ; foobar" ; ls -l ; </tt>)
using regular expressions. I suggested him to use a parser generator, and
then said that his teacher has forbidden him from using it or any other
external CPAN module and that he could only use regular expressions, in order
to, get this: write some Perl code that will convert Bash to Python.
Yes! His teacher expects them to learn those three languages at once.
And apparently without making a judicious use of the proper APIs.
</p>

<p>
Teaching three languages at the same time (in what may be a introductory course)
is wrong and should be avoided, as learning one language is hard enough,
and with three the students may become extremely confused. In
response to my <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/education/introductory-language/">Thoughts about the Best Introductory
[Programming] Language</a>, a friend suggested that one should teach three
introductory languages, and if I were remember correctly, they were something
like C, a convenient dynamic language such as Perl or Python, and a very "mind
expanding" language like Lisp or Haskell. I noted the same thing back then,
that it would confuse the heck out of the students, and here the motivation
is even more flimsy.
</p>

<p>
I wonder if we ever top this homework assignment that we are being asked
for help with. Will a professor ask his students to implement a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI">Strong AI</a> in a weekend?

<div class="entry" id="what-does-simple-mean-in-the-context-of-software">

<!-- Tags: perl, open source, linux

<h2>2012-10-08: What does “Simple” mean in the context of software?</h2>

<p>
A lot of computer programs, and especially many open-source applications
like to boast that they are “simple”. But what does it mean? Given the various
applications and misapplications of this word, I can think of several
meanings:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Easy to use.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Lacks complexity (whatever that means and implies).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Simplistic.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Minimalistic.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Lacks extraneous features.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Very often, these meanings are at conflict with one another. For example,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME">GNOME</a> developers have been
keen on making the feature set as minimalistic (in accordance to meaning
#4) as possible, which has taken the project to spiraling depths of
unusability (opposing meaning #1). Furthermore,
<a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> taglines itself as
“a lightweight and flexible Linux® distribution that tries to Keep It
<b>Simple</b>”. However, during one day, I spent three incredibly vexing
hours in trying to install it on a Virtual Box virtual machine, due to the
installer's lack of usability, and if I had to do it on live hardware, it
would have taken me much longer. You call that simple? I joked that it would
take an engineering degree from a prestigious university to figure it out. I
have that, but it did not help me much.
</p>

<p>
As a result, I have become incredibly suspicious and weary of any software
that prides itself on its “simplicity”, even though “simplicity” should
be a good thing.
</p>

<p>
Bjarne Stroustrup (the creator of C++) has this to say about Java on
<a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html">his FAQ</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Much of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new languages -
partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness. As time passes,
Java will grow significantly in size and complexity. It will double or triple
in size and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries. That is the
way every commercially successful language has developed. Just look at any
language you consider successful on a large scale. I know of no exceptions, and
there are good reasons for this phenomenon. [I wrote this before 2000; now
(2012), the language part of the Java 7 specification is slightly longer in
terms of number of pages than the ISO C++11 language specification.]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So simplicity is often a function of immaturity and incompleteness.
</p>

<p>
Of course, some things that call themselves “simple” are not simple in any
of the meanings, for example
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a>, the so-called “Simple
Object Access Protocol” (see <a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/11/15/the-s-stands-for-simple/">the
S stands for Simple</a>), is not simple in any of the meanings I have
given, but it is still called like that.
</p>

<p>
I feel that like
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/define-zionism/">the word “Zionism”</a> no one is no longer sure what “simplicity” means,
and as a result, some people no longer consider it a good quality to have.
It’s a shame, but that’s life.

<h2>2012-02-18: Tech Tips: Vim, Facebook and Firefox’s Personas Rotator Extension</h2>

<p>
Here are three tech tips, that I felt did not necessitate their own
entry.
</p>

<p>
In the <b>Vim</b> text editor(<a href="http://www.vim.org/">homepage</a>),
one can use the keybinding <tt>Ctrl+W ; O</tt> to close all windows except
the current one, which will be the <b>only</b> one left open (hence
the "O").
</p>

<p>
In <b>Facebook</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Wikipedia
page</a>) one can use Shift+Enter to start newlines in the messages you compose
in the site’s composer. Press it twice to start a new paragraph.
</p>

<p>
If you are using <b>Firefox’s Personas Rotator Extension</b> (
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/personas-rotator/">Addons.mozilla.org page</a>), then you can switch the currently shown persona (
in case you don't want it at the moment) using Ctrl+Alt+P or an alternate
configurable keybinding. I discovered this latest tip by accident and can no
longer imagine my life without it.
</p>

<div class="entry" id="why-java-sucks-for-cross-platform-gui">

<h2>2012-02-18: Why Java Sucks for Cross-Platform GUI</h2>

<p>
When the Java programming language first became publicised, it was heralded as
the dawn of a new age of writing cross-platform programs. “Write once, run
everywhere” they said. Now, 16 years after 1996, which was roughly when the
Java hype started, I’d like to check if it delivered on this promise, by
seeing if one can easily write a cross-platform GUI (= Graphical User-Interace)
application using it. What I’m looking for is a Java GUI library that:
<b>1.</b> Compiles. <b>2.</b> Is cross-platform. <b>3.</b> Does not suck.
Teaser: I was not able to find one.
</p>

<p>
The standard Java
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29"><b>SWING</b> toolkit</a>is out-of-the-question due to its weird look and feel and crappy behaviour
everywhere. Joel on Software has this to say about SWING:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If you still think that something as small as how long you hold down the Alt
key when you activate a menu command doesn't matter, well, your software is
going to make people unhappy. These tiny inconsistencies are what makes Swing
applications so unbearably annoying to use, and in my opinion it's why there
are virtually no commercially successful Java GUI applications.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(From <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/navlinks/fog0000000262.html">the
book reviews</a>, there's more criticism of it
in <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LordPalmerston.html">“Lord
Palmerston on Programming”</a>.)
</p>

<p>
I too have been frustrated by the unusable Java SWING GUIs, and in
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nurikabe-maker/">one of the
latest projects I am contributing to</a>, which has already been written in
Java, I ran into a particularly buggy SWING UI.
</p>

<p>
The Eclipse people implemented something called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Widget_Toolkit">SWT</a>, but
according to the wikipedia, it has several limitations, and require writing
a lot of platform-dependent code.
</p>

<p>
Next are the Qt bindings to Java -
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_Jambi">Qt Jambi</a>. These require
customising the <tt>build.properties</tt> (whereas the error and documentation
says one should edit the <tt>buildpath.properties</tt> file), and after
that fails compiling with this error:
</p>

<pre>
[make] ../../generator/out/cpp/com_trolltech_qt_core/qtjambishell_QFutureIterator.cpp:21:15: error: no matching function for call to ‘QFutureIterator&lt;JObjectWrapper&gt;::QFutureIterator()’
</pre>

<p>
Next I looked into java-gnome, but apparently it does not work on Windows, so
it's not cross-platform.
</p>

<p>
And the Java bindings for wxWidgets offer
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxjava/">wxJava</a>, which
is Windows-only and unmaintained, and
<a href="http://wx4j.sourceforge.net/">wx4j</a>
and <a href="http://jwx.sourceforge.net/">jwx!</a>, which are unmaintained
and no longer build.
</p>

<p>
So I think that leaves us with nothing. How sad. Compare that to
the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Gui_Toolkits">comprehensive coverage
of Mono’s GUI toolkits</a>, many of which are cross-platform, and to the
situation in other languages such as Perl or Python, and you'll see that
Java sucks the most in this respect.
</p>

<div class="entry" id="why-I-dont-trust-non-FOSS-software">

<!-- Tags: open source, programming
-->

<h2>2012-02-18: Why I Don’t Trust Non-Open Source Software</h2>

<p>
Today I’m going to explain in a dedicated entry, why I do not trust
programs that are not
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and
open-source software (FOSS)</a> and instead are more restricted. I have
previously told that story as part of
<a href="http://better-scm.shlomifish.org/docs/shlomif-evolution.html">a
different essay</a>, but it was easy to miss.
</p>

<p>
In any case, the <a href="http://better-scm.shlomifish.org/bk/">BitKeeper
version control system</a> is now quite obscure, due to the advent of quality
distributed open-source systems such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">Git</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial">Mercurial</a>, but
some years ago it was used by many developers of the Linux kernel, and the
demise of its gratis version was in fact the impetus for the creation of
Git, and later Mercurial. Some time, before Linus Torvalds adopted it,
I ran into a limitation of CVS, an open-source version control system,
that was then popular, and was looking for an alternative, and after reading
an out-of-date article about BitKeeper (which said its source was available
under a mostly open source licence), decided to use it and its bkbits.net
service.
</p>

<p>
At first, I was quite happy using it for some of my projects, but then I
posted a question to the mailing list, asking where I can find the source,
which was implied to be available on the BitKeeper site. Larry McVoy
(BitKeeper's main creator and maintainer) answered by saying that they decided
for removing the source code, because some users modified it to remove the
restrictions, and allowed them to abuse the licensing of the gratis version
and prevent them from paying for the commercial version. He also noted that
availability of source, meant that, in practice, your software was Public
Domain, and that they provide the sources for people they can trust,
in private.
</p>

<p>
At that point, I figured out that I don't have an immediate need for the
source, and that perhaps in the future, I can win BitMover (= BitKeeper’s
parent company) trust and gain access to it. So I continued using BitKeeper.
</p>

<p>
That changed, however, when Mr. McVoy announced a licence change to BitKeeper
(while requiring all users of the gratis version to upgrade) that
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/shlomif/diary/78.html">I found
unacceptable</a>, and caused me to seek a different alternative. This
caused an unpleasant exchange between me and the BitKeeper developers,
and made me lose some of the repositories I hosted on bkbits.net.
</p>

<p>
From that moment on, I realised that I cannot really trust non-open-source
software, because even if I am allowed to continue to use its previous version
after a licence change, then it may accumulate bugs or stop being runnable
on my systems, or stop being supported, and I cannot risk it. To quote
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard
Stallman</a>: “Every non-free [= non-FOSS] program has a lord, a master —
and if you use the program, he is your master”.
</p>

<p>
The end of the BitKeeper story, was that after evaluating a few open-source
alternatives, I settled on using the open-source Subversion, and later on
also started using Mercurial and Git. Furthermore, from then on, I often
refused to look at and evaluate proprietary programs. Lately, many open-source
developers have been infatuated with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text">Sublime Text</a>, but
I am not willing to even try it, because it is not open-source, so I will
never have to depend on it.
</p>

<p>
Despite all that, I still license my original software under
non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">Copyleft</a> licences,
because the GPLv2 and the GPLv3 are incompatible, both
with one another, and with many other open-source licences, and because
I know of at least three different interpretations to the GPL (
GNU’s one in the GPL FAQ, the Linux kernel's one, and the draconian
<a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/COPYING" rel="nofollow">Nmap
interpretation</a>), and because I want my code to be of the maximal available
use without the need to consult a lawyer, and because I don't want to be
worried about how it will possibly be abused, when I don't care if it will.
I'm still using GPLed software, in the hope that I won't get sued.
</p>

<p>
To sum up, I do not wish to rely on non-FOSS, because it may mean these
software applications later becomes unavailable to me, in a similar
manner to what was the case with BitKeeper. I hope you can relate to that,
and if not, you may likely run into a similar situation in the future,
as well also the case for the Linux kernel project, with the demise of
the gratis BitKeeper altogether.

<h2>2012-12-10: Tech Tip: Overriding the Audio Track of a Video using ffmpeg</h2>

<p>
In this tip I will cover how to use ffmpeg to override the audio track of a
video from a different audio track (such as the one in a WAV, an OGG or an
MP3 file). To do that use the following recipe (based on
<a href="http://cfc.kizzx2.com/index.php/muxing-audio-and-video-with-ffmpeg/">this
out-of-date blog post</a> and some help from ubitux on
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#ffmpeg">#ffmpeg</a>, with a lot of
trial and error):
</p>

<pre>
ffmpeg -i in_audio.wav -i in_video.ogv -map 0:0 -map 1:1 -shortest \
    -c:a libvorbis -q:a 7 -c:v copy output.ogv
</pre>

<p>
Some of these files are not needed if you're not dealing with Ogg Video files.
<tt>-shortest</tt> is useful for making sure that the length of the output
is trimmed to that of the shortest input.
</p>

<p>
I ended up using this command for

<h2>2012-09-06: Joke: “NSA Facts”</h2>

<p>
Yesterday, I had the idea of creating some “facts” about the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency">NSA - the
United States National Security Agency</a>, similar to the Chuck Norris
Facts meme. And I got some
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/">pretty
good factoids</a> so far, which I will share here:
</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
The NSA doesn't publish. They perish.
</li>
<li>
The NSA employs the largest number of mathematicians with Ph.D. And the most
stupid and incompetent ones.
</li>
<li>
The NSA has a patent for an efficient process for collecting a lot of
information and doing nothing with it.
</li>
<li>
The Bajoran scholars have positively identified Benjamin Sisko as
The Emissary. They also positively identified the NSA headquarters
as The Dungeon.
</li>
<li>
One of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>’s episodes took place in the NSA
headquarters, but had to be destroyed, because all of the test audience had
uncontrollable panic attacks.
</li>
<li>
The NSA knows what you did last summer. But no one, in the NSA or outside it,
knows why they should.
</li>
<li>
The more the NSA think, the less they want to be able to think.
So they think less and less.
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>
Hope you enjoyed it and naturally - “ha ha, only serious!”. Now the ball is in
your court
- can you think of more? Put them in the comments below.
</p>

<p>
Happy NSA bashing!

<h2>2012-12-10: Tech Tip: Disabling Audio or Video in mplayer and VLC</h2>

<p>
In order to completely disable video in VLC, from the command line, use
the <code>--novideo</code> command line flag - this way only the Audio will
be heard. To do the same in mplayer, use the <code>-novideo</code> flag.
You can do the same for audio using <code>--noaudio</code> and
<code>-noaudio</code> respectively.
</p>

<p>
A different propsoed solution is using <code>-vo none</code> in mplayer
or <code>--vo none</code> in VLC, but this causes the video to still be decoded
(just not presented) - at least in VLC.

<h2>2008-12-24: Tech Tip: Tmux: Disabling the Time Display in the Status</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a> is a usable and open source
terminal multiplexer (that allows one to run several programs in the same
terminal, detach them, split them into windows and viewports, etc.) which
I've been happily using after switching to it from GNU screen. Some weeks
ago, I noticed that if I keep tmux open in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konsole">konsole</a> tab, then
eventually that tab got highlighted as modified, even if there was no activity
in the tab. I realised the problem had to do with the fact that tmux displays
the current time by default.
</p>

<p>
In order to fix it, you can use a line like the following in your
<code>~/.tmux.conf</code> file:
</p>

<pre>
set -g status-right '#H'
</pre>

<p>
<code>-g</code> applies the assignment globally, and <code>'#H'</code>
displays the hostname (and not the time or whatever else is there by default).
</p>

<p>
While searching for an answer, I ran into the
<a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline">powerline</a> project
which provides much more functionality, seems like an overkill for me,
but may work for you.

<h2>2008-12-24: Tech Tip: How to Copy a Remote File on rsync.net</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://rsync.net/">rsync.net</a> is a good service (and a not too
pricey one) for remote storage of data (for backups/etc.) based on open
protocols and open source applications. One thing that bugged me there however,
was that I couldn't find a way to copy a remote file to a different
name, because the SFTP client does not support a copy operation, and because
I could not get to a login shell by sshing my rsync.net account. Apparently,
it's doable and not very hard.
</p>

<p>
What you need to do is type
<code>ssh my_account@somewhere.rsync.net cp [source filename] [destination filename]</code> and
it will run the remote UNIX "cp" command to copy the file. You can access
some other remote UNIX commands like that such as "ls".
</p>

<p>
Hope it helps.

<h2>2013-11-13: The GNU Project Will Integrate GNU Guile into GNU coreutils</h2>

<p>
<b>Tel Aviv, Israel:</b> the GNU (= “Guile N' UNIX”) project announced today
that following the popular decision to integrate GNU Guile (= an implementation
of the Scheme programming language) into GNU Make, it is going to integrate
GNU Guile into the various tools inside GNU coreutils. So for example, GNU
cat will have a "-g" flag that will allow embedding Scheme expressions, GNU
echo will gain a similar flag, and GNU true and GNU false will allow evaluating
Scheme expressions for truth or falsehood. It is not yet clear what
functionality GNU head and GNU tail will gain by the integration.
</p>

<p>
O’Reilly Media announced that it will publish a new edition of its
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Mastering-Cat/">series of
books</a>, which includes <i>Mastering cat</i> and <i>Mastering echo</i> to
cover the additional functionality provided by GNU Guile, and we will give
an overview of the additional functionality in
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/New-Israeli-Tech-Usergroups/">the
usergroups</a> of the cat mongers, the echo-chamberists, and the (GNU) true
believers.
</p>

<p>
“If it’s not bloat, it’s not us.”, said Richard Stallman, the colourful
head of the GNU project, and started to sing the Free Software song. Linus
Torvalds was not available for comments about the proposal to integrate
GNU Guile into the Linux kernel.

<h2>2013-12-31: Tech Tip: Combining/Merging Bookmarks From a Different Firefox Profile</h2>

<p>
Happy New Civil Year!
Let’s suppose you collected some bookmarks in a different <a
href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> profile (possibly on a different
computer or system, or in a different profile), and wish to place them
somewhere under your current or main profile’s bookmark tree - how can it
be done? I had a need for that and in this entry, I describe a solution that worked for me.
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
First of all export your bookmarks from the source profile to a JSON
file (“Bookmarks → Show All Bookmarks → Import and Backup → Backup…”)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Create a new Firefox profile in the machine of the target profile.
(see <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=Profiles">this page</a>
for more information about Firefox profiles.).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Import the bookmarks from the JSON file to it (while overriding the default
bookmarks).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Copy all the folders you want to merge to the system clipboard
(<code>Ctrl+C</code> or equivalent).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Paste them into the default profile’s bookmark manager.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Then all you need to do is sort them. Cheers!

<h2>2014-01-02: Tech Tip: Mitigating “git clone”’s inability to be resumed using rsync</h2>

<p>
Happy new civil year, everyone. As you may know
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">Git</a> is
a distributed version control system, but its often time-consuming (if the
repository’s history is large) “git clone” operation cannot be resumed, which
is a problem with bad Internet connections. There was a service that did
“git clone” and then allowed people to download using HTTPS Called “Git
bundler” but it has been down for sometime now. However, I found a different
solution to the problem.
</p>

<p>
What can be done is use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"><b>ssh</b></a>
to log in to a remote host, where the “git clone” is performed (preferably,
but not absolutely necessarily, when running on top of a session of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux">tmux</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen">GNU Screen</a> or
similar). After that, you can use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a> over ssh to download
the .git directory to the local workstation (I like to use
the invocation <code>rsync -a --progress -v --inplace</code> for that).
</p>

<p>
Following that all you have to do is run git clone to a different directory
to the one where you put the <code>.git</code> and set “git remote” appropriately.
</p>

<p>
Hope that helps, and the same can be done with other distributed version
control systems such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial">Mercurial</a>,
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazaar_%28software%29">Bzr</a>.

<!-- Tags: tech tip, tech, tip, web

<h2>2014-01-02: Tech Tip: Empty &lt;div&gt; tag in XHTML served as text/html</h2>

<p>
If you serve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML">XHTML</a> (= HTML
written using XML grammar and conventions) as
<code>Content-Type: text/html</code>, you may be tempted to write an empty
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag as a standalone XML tag with a trailing
slash using <code>&lt;div id="my_anchor" /&gt;</code>. Don’t do that, because
with <code>text/html</code> (a.k.a “tag-soup”) the browser may
think you just have an opening tag and will look for a closing tag
elsewhere. Instead, write a pair of opening and closing tags, e.g:
<code>&lt;div id="my_anchor"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
Using the first form confused both Firefox (24.2.x in my case) and Google
Chromium (whatever shipped with Mageia at the time), and made them misrender
my page, despite the fact that it validated as valid XHTML. Perhaps I should
have considered putting the <code>id=".."</code> inside a meaningful
sub-section of the document, but I implemented something for skipping a
section navigation menu.

<h2>2014-03-08: Tech Tip: Resetting the GLib/Gtk+ Default Apps on Linux (e.g: the Default Browser)</h2>

<p>
In this tip, I would like to describe how to reset the default apps, and
especially the default browser, for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLib">GLib</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK%2B">GTK+</a>. These
are used by the desktops like GNOME and XFCE, and by GTK+ applications
such as HexChat or claws-mail. My problem originally was that I accidentally
pressed the "Yes" button when Firefox Nightly (installed under a prefix
under <code>/opt</code>) asked me whether I should set it as the default
browser, which caused HexChat and Claws-Mail to open links using it by
default.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, to resolve this problem do this:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Go to <code>~/.local/share/applications</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Backup this directory somewhere safe.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <code>mimeapps.list</code> file contains the reference to use the offending
apps under the <code>*.desktop</code> files there which you can search
for the reference to the apps.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Remove these line or their portions from <code>mimeapps.list</code>.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Now you may need to restart the desktop apps or the desktop environment (not
sure).
</p>

<p>
Hope it helps.
