Thanks for you message.

> Most of the people asking obviously bullshit questions deleted their account...so obviously sock-puppets run by OP himself.

You're jumping to conclusions: I swear I didn't solicit or delete them (and I'm a very honest man, who almost never lies on purpose).

> Then he links his site in nearly every reply, along with wikipedia articles...wtf.

Yes, because they are relevant to my reply. This interview is about me.
Furthermore , I didn't originate most of these wikipedia articles.

> You're not notable and this an obvious attempt at self-promotion.

First of all, I didn't see anything in the IAmA rules that I have to be very notable to answer it.

Secondly, I am notable. Perhaps not as much as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Watson , but I am still notable.

For example: here are some Slashdot.org features linking to features on my site:

Two of my reddit.com features got a reputation of about 100:

I had some other posts of above 10?

I also wrote [Freecell Solver](http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/), for which I received 100s of emails and which sparked a lively community of users, contributors and co-developers, and I was an active contributor to perl 5 , CPAN (over a 100 modules and maintenance of XML::LibXML ), Subversion, GIMP and other projects.

Regarding self-promotion: assuming I am promoting myself - so what? How am I harming other people in the process? It took me over half a lifetime to create my home site - starting from [a humble beginning in 1997](http://old-1998-site.shlomifish.org/) and I'm very proud of it and often find something of relevance there. I admit it is my intention to further promote it because I think throughout all this time [my publicity was heavily lacking](https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/src/734dceb6c36f5b000710e6ec4e3204ed6e2f6de8/human-networking.markdown?at=default).
