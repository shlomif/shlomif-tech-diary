Hi Zach!
</p>

<p>
This does not surprise me. As religious people and especially clergymen tend to be, they are irrational, "power"-hungry, and malevolent. I think it's <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/define-zionism/">high time Israel abolished its constitutional discrimination</a>, as it's causing too much damage and no good. See <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/53343.html">my entry about it</a>.
</p>

<p>
I <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/">oppose religion and think all religions of the world are destructive, irrational and silly</a>, including the Jewish religion (but not Judaism in general, which is a peopleship.). As <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#if_god_exists">I noted</a>: "If God exists and is the ego-maniacal, sadistic and helpless creature that is described in the Old Testament, then we're in deep trouble".

Sorry, just needed to let out a little steam.
