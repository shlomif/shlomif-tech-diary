OK, here's what I thought: it was a wonderful film. Perfect in almost every way. It didn't have a slow start at all as opposed to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook which I think was the previous film I saw in the cinema, or many other films. It "Showed me the money!" and kept me captivated extremely quickly which I can appreciate.

As I saw it, the main message of the film was that people (or teenage mutant ninja turtles - ;-)) should be entrusted with power regardless of how weak, immature, young, old, quirky, etc. they seem, as they will respond to that trust by being responsible. [Saladin entrusted the Knights Templar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shlomif/Saladin_Style#Trust_and_Respect) with power, and they started off as villainous, paranoid, and suffering from many mental illnesses, and after earning his trust they became happy, peaceful, benevolent, and almost completely sane.

In the film, the various characters are at first not trusted with power, and so violate it. Then they learn to trust each other.

I admit part of the reason I went to see the film is that I'm a big fan of Megan Fox, having had originally seen her as the [sexy and "jailbait" 16-years old on Two and a Half Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaqL-3xOHPA) and later seeing her on various (incredibly sexy) still photographs. Her role in the film is not as sexualised as one could have hoped, but it seems appropriate given the plot, and she plays it incredibly well. She also seem much more at ease/at peace (or at [“Shalom”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom)) with her role than with the one at 2.5 Men, which I can appreciate.

The film is also very funny, and I loved the part where the turtles make music using their weapons while waiting for the elevator to arrive. I also appreciated the stereotypical popculture/immature teenager aspect of the turtles, which was very funny.

The film is full of action heroism, whose modern synonym is one of the many meanings of "hacking", where like my interpretation of the famous myth of [“David vs. Goliath”](http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/david_and_goliath.html) it involves any kind of bending or breaking the rules, to earn your victory, and finding worthawhile workarounds and bypasses, rather than abidiing by many visible and invisible rules and accepting your "fate", which is almost certainly stagnation and death (also see [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z9Ismh1elM) for Hamlet starring Arnold Schwarzenegger to truly understand the distinction).

Anyway, some of the most intense action scenes almost made me want to rise up my chair from excitement.

I also loved the slight Japanese culture tangent to the story, whether or not it accurately reflected the true Japanese culture, because it is also important to mix and match cultures to avoid cultural stagnation - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=larry-wall-all-truth-is-gods-truh

What else? I think the other actors and voice actors played very well too and I especially enjoyed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg playing the bitchy and older boss of April O'Neill (= Megan Fox's character and the reporter who helps the turtles and the main protagonist of the film), even though it was a small role. Being 1977 born, and growing up mostly in the 90s I have a soft spot in my heart for Goldberg, who was a very big thing back then, like in this immortal scene from Sister Act: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHASQg8fR0s .

I thought I'd have to leave my brain at the door in this film, but found various utterances of people incredibly thought provoking, which I appreciated.

Now for a little personal angel (and I realise it's crazy, but 100% normal people are never fun): I want Megan Fox to serve as the backup actress for [the role of Summer Glau](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/cast.html#cast__sglau) (assuming Summer Glau herself would prefer to avoid playing it which something about her tells me she may not) in my screenplay Summerschool at the NSA. Currently, Hollywood still does not believe in giving awards for excellent roles in excellent "summer blockbuster" films such as the TMNT film, but Summerschool at the NSA is a film that is very political, takes itself seriously (despite trying being funny) and is full of social activism, and taking part in it may lead Ms. Fox to the coveted position of Hollywood's "alpha female" displacing Jennifer Lawrence (whom I want to [play the waitress](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/cast.html#cast__waitress) there) and think that as a single 24 years old, she will appreciate being Sic Transit Gloria Mundi'd into "alpha female emerita".

Speaking of Sic Transit Gloria Mundi (STGM), it is my hope that following the filming of Summerschool at the NSA, which as lame as it appears, my role as the [“Hacker Monarch”](https://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/gyrcAfAASev) of the world at large, and pass the baton to a more ambitious Hacker Monarch wannabe, whom I certainly hope is the afforementioned [Summer Glau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau), and thus successfully concluding the 2000-2014 Web 2.0/open content revolution.

Anyway, I'm not giving up on all that, and realise that as long as I continue fighting for it, I will earn my victory. And contrary to common thought, such struggling is fun, enlightening and rewarding. I hope to get SummerNSA filmed in one way or another, and however lame and unprofessional it will or will seem to critics (I would even be happy with some 16 years olds producing and voicing it as Pony-art), it will likely be awesome.

Summer Glau jehovah Qoheleth! [= judeo-Objectivism for "Summer Glau will be the new Hacker Monarch"] ! Hackers of the world - unite!
