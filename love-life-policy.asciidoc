If a woman "rape-kiss"es me, https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/true-stories/my-first-kiss/[I will not resist and even try to enjoy it]. Do note that it will still feel awkward, so please don't do this.

Given there are many women (and likely many men)Â whom my mismanagement as https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/multiverse-cosmology/[a Terran terminator] caused heartbreak, sadness, and grief, I will accept date invitations from any woman who isn't overly fat and unkempt. Before it, she and I will donate some money to a charity of her choice, and tweet about it, while possibly hyperlinking to her website. At the end of the date, we may both hug upon mutual agreement.

Given I enjoy
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/bad_acting_ftw.xhtml[hacky acting], I may need to kiss fellow actresses on stage.

I don't own 100% of your sex-life either.

Nevertheless, I still have the need for an intimate, Romantic relationship. With a woman. I cannot guarantee I'll love you forever, but let me know when and if I'm taking you too much for granted.

One of my favourite pastimes is crossover https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/image-macros/indiv-nodes/standup_philosopher.xhtml[stand-up comedy/philosophy] (or one done on online chats). Other pasttimes I enjoy include:

* biking
* webpublishing and blogging
* screenwriting
* software development

Until further notice, I do not pose naked or scantily clad. You can try hiring a temporary lookalike of mine or peruse https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records[the Akashic records]. I am open for modelling captioned T-shirts, and shorts.

If you tie me to bed, or lock me inside/outside, I might break up with you, and get a restraining order.

If we divorce, you can have https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16480/jewish/Chapter-7.htm[half my cash] (or more?). I'll https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/[likely make it back]. Furthermore, I will not require alimony from you.

I try to prioritize helping people online / offline:

Let's suppose, without loss of generality, that your premarital name is Jane Austen.

Then:

* I will remain Mr. Shlomi Fish.
* We can call the children "Austen" but hopefully not "Austen-Fish"
