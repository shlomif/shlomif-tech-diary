Today I went on a relatively long walk down Chaim Levanon St. and saw some interesting people:

* An attractive lady who was barearmed and had a tatoo on her arm.

* A boy who had an Adidas backpack, and a shirt whose caption read "awesome".

* Two young men who were practicing kickboxing.

* A cute girl who rode the bike opposite me, had earphones, and had a horrid
expression indicating she was feeling unpleasant.

* Two mothers who were carrying their babies and met at the corner and talked.

* A young girl who was apparently crossing the road with her father, with a shirt that read "L.A. State of Mind".
