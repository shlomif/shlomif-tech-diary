Hi all,

Abstract: This document details a plan for how [Summer Glau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau) can interact with her fans online in a mostly safe and secure manner.

On the Internet, making sure you can interact on social media outlets is a hard problem. For Summer Glau, it proved to be difficult. Nevertheless, there are some effective strategies she (and other public figures) could take to be able to interact with her fans, and still remain secure.

From what I heard about Summer in previous discussions on /r/SummerGlau , she used to have a private Facebook account which was repetitively compromised, and also that she used to have a site that is now offline (possibly with forums), and also that she found it hard to cope with such harsh criticism on Internet venues. Thus, I’ll try to deal with each problem in turn.

Here are my points:

1. Summer should definitely avoid Facebook, because its scope is too big, it is too buggy (including some strange bugs that occur and disappear at random), and its APIs keep getting broken. Google-Plus should provide a useful alternative along with [reddit](http://reddit.com/), Twitter, [Freenode](http://freenode.net/), YouTube, etc.

2. Summer can ask or even hire a resident computer/software/hardware geek to help her with the technicalities of interacting on such mediums. Being independent does not mean that one does not ask for help or even pays for it, or ask or pays for advice. This is not [Feudalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism) taken to its natural extreme. Instead, what independence means is that one makes their own decisions and takes responsibility for their actions.

Note that I’m not trying to imply that Summer is necessarily still lacking the technical know-how. I’m almost sure she can, after overcoming some amount of initial difficulty, or has already become inclined in using such computer technology. The vast majority of people can with the right attitude.

3. I suggest that Summer will use a mostly secure, popular and mainstream, Linux distribution such as [Linux Mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Mint), to be extra careful. Many Linux distributions are relatively easy to use and I heard of some grandmothers past their 70th birthday, who are using them, because they have the right attitude. And one can always [get help online](http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/how-to-get-help-online/), or ask a resident technical guru for help, or even pay them for the privilege.

(Note: I am using Mageia Linux, and while I like it and enjoy contributing to it, it is currently suffering from a lack of contributors and mainstream popularity and acceptance, and so I’d rather recommend something else in this case.)

4. Summer should use a different password for every site. One option would be to use a password management service (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager ), and as noted in [this xkcd issue](http://xkcd.com/936/) one can easily use long and mostly meaningful passwords instead of short and obscure ones, but Summer should make sure to use a radically different one for each site.

I wouldn’t worry about the NSA spying on you or Summer or whoever, because even if they can, they are practically a black hole of information. See my [NSA factoids page](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/) and the [“#SummerNSA” hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23SummerNSA) (originally short for “Summerschool at the NSA”) for some more insights, and as is well understood a person who is too paranoid about security is miserable, and a miserable person is insecure.

5. Regarding handling online criticism which may be the hardest part for a person to do. We can learn a little from the story of [Tiffany Alvord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord), a young (1992-born) YouTube singer and performer, and a very inspiring person, who, while being a complete extrovert on camera and on stage, testified that she is shy in real life and that she lacks the confidence to join a conversation. So she has an opposite problem from Summer’s.

What is the solution? Take a deep breath and go for it. Expect to fail at first, or expect to fail sometimes always, but remember [Samuel Beckett’s words](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett#Worstward_Ho_.281983.29) that “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”

Practice makes perfect, and you are allowed to “fail” and make a bad impression, and “Rome was not built in a day”. Furthermore, one should never let one’s fear of being hurt emotionally paralyse them, because it prevents future growth.

Another useful piece of advice is to study [the Cognitive Therapy approach to handling criticism](http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/909.html) (also see the comments and the discussion on that page), which helps a lot.

Finally, Summer may wish to get hold of Tiffany (who is also based in southern California) so the two of them can learn and help each other.

6. Finally, I should note that I and most of the other fans of Summer will like her and love her, no matter what she does, as long as it’s not something really crazy like murdering someone, or driving while being drunk, which she is extremely unlikely to do. As the old fable of [“The miller, his son, and the donkey”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey) shows, it is impossible to please everybody at any given moment, so you should not even try. I will always accept her, and won’t think less of her, because it’s her choices, and her life, and she’s still going to remain a wonderful lady. Also see my [tweet about treating all women as ladies](https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/478025441983213569) .

----

It’s not 100% straightforward, but not too hard either, and I hope I have explained how it can be done. In this day and age, having a good online presence is extremely helpful for publicity, success, and for one’s inspiration and competence, and I wish the best for Summer, so I think she should consider taking most or all of this advice.
