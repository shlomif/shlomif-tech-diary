<h2>2008-06-11: When Syntax Matters</h2>

<p>
If you're a computer geek, it isn't uncommon to hear something like
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22xml+is+just+s-expressions%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">"XML is just S-expressions"</a>, only with a different
syntax. Well, while it seems logical, we might as well argue that:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Every data can be encoded as 1's or 0's.
</li>
<li>
We can write any program using <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_logic">NAND gates</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Both of these claims are correct that no one will find it convenient to
encode data as 1's and 0's or to design everything using NAND gates
exclusively.
