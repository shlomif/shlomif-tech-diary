You can read the humorous story <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">"The Enemy and How I Helped to Fight it"</a> on my homepage in both English and (in case its relevant for you) Hebrew versions. Here is the abstract:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A member of the terrorist organisation "The Organisation" gets up in the morning, goes to his post and quits. But before he leaves he makes a suggestion that causes his former comrades to fight each other to the death. Join the now ex-Member of the Organisation as he embarks on an ego-trip, where he tries to prove that A can in fact be non-A, regardless of what Aristotle could differ.
</p>

<p>
It's a political satire, but one that is universal in its message, and touches on many aspects of politics, logic and Objectivist philosophy.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
It is my belief as someone who studied some philosophy and psychology, (while still being a software developer by trade) that the key for our long term prosperity and happiness is following reason, logic, rationality, and tolerance in order to confront the myriad of feelings we may possess, whether rational or not, and the various dogmas that our friends or enemies may believe in. I tried to convey this message in the story, which I've written back in 1997.
