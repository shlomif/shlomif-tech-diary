A new month is upon us, and we need to set up a new meeting. So I'd like to 
give a step by step guide to organizing a new meeting:

-------------------------------
1. Coordinate a date with Aduva
-------------------------------

We meet in Tuesdays, usually the second or third of every month. In any case,
the date in which the meeting will take place needs to be coordinated with
Aduva in advance. The rules as set up by Lior Kesos from Aduva are:

<<<<<<<<<
First of all I'd like to set down the rules for meetings taking place in 
aduva.

1. In each meeting an aduva representative must be present. (Probably me 
or Chen).
2. Time table must be coordinated with aduva (actually me) before you 
decide what date we can meet at. Maybe there is a scheduled meeting at 
aduva at the same time etc...
3. I need to ok it in advance and secure the room and then we get our 
meeting.
4. I'll be in charge of the coordination both with us and the perl group 
which hinted it may appreciate the same hospitality.
5. I believe we need to coordinate our meeting with the perl group 
meaning we require to alternate the meetings.
    something like perl has first week in month python has third - this 
is being done so we do not give aduva an over dose of community activist 
roaming it's   corridors... :)

Please coordinate with me either through the list or privately 
(0524305252 or by mail)  when you want to set up meetings in the future.

We'd like to make this a long term relationship (between aduva and the 
OSS community).
Aduva recognizes the value and the need to "give back" and to help OSS 
in Israel in whatever means it has.
I'd like to add that it's very important we do this in an orderly 
fashion if we want this arrangement to be more then temporary.

best regards
Lior Kesos

They can be found in a permanent location here:

http://www.mail-archive.com/python%40linux.org.il/msg00041.html

Then you have to wait until the date is acknowledged.

--------------------------------------------
2. Create a page for the meeting in the Wiki
--------------------------------------------

Once the date is set up, you need to create a meeting page for it in the 
wiki. The events page is:

http://www.python.org.il/mediawiki/index.php/Events

You need to:

1) Move the upcoming meeting link to the end of the previous meetings
list.

2) Create a stale link ([[Meeting DD Month YYYY]]) instead.

3) Access the previous meeting link and copy its text. Paste it in the new
page of the stale link.

4) Modify the upcoming meeting page appropriately.

--------------------------------------------
3. Notify the mailing list about the meeting
--------------------------------------------

Once the page has been set up (even in a rudimentary way), you notify the 
mailing list about the meeting. Include the following information:

1) Date.

2) Link to the Wiki Page.

3) Say that one can find more information there.

4) Ask people whether they can give presentations then.

---------------------------------------------
4. Put the meeting in the Whatsup Event Board
---------------------------------------------

The meeting should be filed in the PostCalendar on whatsup.org.il as soon as
possible.

-----------------------------------
5. Publicize the meeting in whatsup
-----------------------------------

The meeting has to be publicized in whatsup.org.il about a week before it
takes place. The title should include the date and day-of-week. The body 
should include date, location, link to the Wiki page, and possibly also 
what presentations would be given.

At the same time an announcement can also be sent to the Linux-IL mailing 
list. (in English).

Note: Shlomi Fish can be notified by E-mail or cell-phone about this so
he can approve of the announcement.

---------------------------------------
6. Publicize the meeting in Linmagazine
---------------------------------------

This is similar to its whatsup publicizing. Linmagazine's back-end has a
special section for events.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Send a last minute announcement to python@linux.org.il and Linux-IL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An announcement about the meeting should also be sent a day before or at the
same day to both python@linux.org.il and Linux-IL.

---------------------
8. During the Meeting
---------------------

1. Buy refreshments and drinks.

2. Pool money to finance the refreshments and drinks.

3. Once everybody arrive pass a sheet of paper where everybody write their
names. These names are transcribed to the wiki afterwards.
