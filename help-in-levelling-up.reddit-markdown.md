# Seeking help in levelling up from vampire to wizard

I am a player character in "TheGame™ of Fantastecha™", currently at class vampire, and wishing to level up to class wizard. I suspect I could use the following:

1. A copy of the rulebook, which I think consists of (1 + 3 + 7 + 9) * 2 items.

2. The whereabouts of [Christina Grimmie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie), who happens to be my favourite "child" (= protege and successor).

Thanks in advance, and keep the faith!
