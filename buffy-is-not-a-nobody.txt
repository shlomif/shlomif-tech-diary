See the video excerpt from the Buffy, the Vampire Slayer episode of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_%28Buffy_episode%29 (S03E01) at: http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/buffy-is-not-a-nobody.mkv - Buffy is not a nobody - she is "Buffy, the vampire slayer" and she and the other trapped kids can kick some serious demonic ass.

For the impatient or the for people with disabilities, here's the transcript quoting from  - under CC-by-sa / GFDL:

<<<
Ken lines the captives up and each one is asked, "Who are you?" and then bludgeoned unless they answer "I'm no one." Buffy realizes this is where the muttering old people on the street have come from. When it's her turn to be asked who she is, she says her name with pride and kicks the demon who asked. She rouses the rest of the captives to fight back and a battle ensues. She's finally stopped as Ken holds Lily at knifepoint. He then delivers a speech about how they're all stuck and will die there, until Lily, who has been passive until now, pushes Ken off a ledge onto the concrete floor. Lily then leads the captives back up through the "pool" as Buffy dispatches Ken, and once all of the humans are out of the demonic dimension, the pool gateway between the dimensions closes.

Now here's my interpretation and philosophising on it:

---------------------------------------

You are not a nobody. You are special. You are unique. You are an individual. You are [insert your name or nickname here]! You are a great and wonderful and a beautiful person. And you too can:

1. Kick some serious ass (figuratively, see episodes 3x19 and 3x20 of “Suddenly Susan” - http://sharetv.com/shows/suddenly_susan/season_3 for the explanation).

2. Change the world for the better.

3. Become the most powerful man or woman on Earth.

4. Become the Messiah and help bring the End of Days.

And it's not farfetched.

You don't have to know martial arts. You can be unemployed, or even homeless. You can be a waitor or a waitress at restaurant. You can be a prostitute. You may be a professional ballerina trainee, which is one of the last remaining artforms where many people believe that professional (= people who dedicated their lives to the study and in a way sold their soul) performers and artists are better than amateur (= people who love what they do, are not obsessed about it, and introspect) and polymath ones. You may be a smoker or an alcoholic or a drug abuser. You may be stuck in some apparently nowhere place and have seemingly very low aspirations (see the film https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook for an example ). You may have a mental illness. Hell, you may have even murdered or mass murdered many people.

But you're a human being and you're not negligible and there is a reason you were born and you can become noble and wonderful and a superhero.

Whenever someone tells me that I'm "a noone", "a nobody", "a loser", "not special", "a small cog in the system" , "another brick in the wall" , etc. I will tell them “No, I’m not. I am Shlomi Fish (a.k.a ‘Rindolf’), the most powerful man on Earth, and the Messiah. Nice to meet you. Now please tell me who are you, and a little or a lot about yourself. Let's be friends.” (see  http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/#reception for some of the context).

Be persistent, have some belief in yourself, and have the understanding that you:

1. Need to bend the rules sometimes (see http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath ) and think of creative, resourceful solutions.

2. That you constantly need to improve yourself (*NEVER* rest on your laurels) and your skills.

3. That you need to become inspired: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLqb64Pb9So

4. That you need to synergetically help and be helped by other people (independence is not about doing anything by yourself, but rather about making your won decisions and asking people for help).

With all this, you too can be a superheroic person.

Note: this is not about being the 1st place. You may not win the Nobel Prize, the Pulitzer Prize; the Academy Awards (Oscar’s); the Fields Medal; the Turing Award or whatever; you may not get the most views on YouTube; you may not have the most Stack Overflow or Reddit reputation; you may not be the No. 1 spot on the Billboard song contest; you may not take the No. 1 place in the Olympics or win the Superbowl, or the Football World Cup.

However, it doesn't mean that if you lose, you're not a winner. Not everyone wins that, but those who don't try or give up, or don't try to improve are the real losers.

Now that I look at Buffy's fighting in that scene, I'm amazed at how much she faught in an amateuristic and improvisational way. But that's the thing: amateurs can be better and more likeable than the pros, because they love what they do. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie, who is a truly inspiring person despite being 1994 born and only 20 years old as of now, started her YouTube videoblog first with blogging about computer games, and then by preparing poor quality videos of her covering many popular songs. But she was persistent, self-critical, and humble, constantly sought to improve herself, seized most opportunities for fame, was grateful to her fans and supporters, and became better, until she's now an exceptionally good singer and performer,  and a big star. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYX8sjIzjGw .

As post-Modernism slowly but surely enough gives way to the scary-but-incredibly-exciting New Age, we are encountering many questions (see http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#machines_that_can_give_questions ) about whether what we did in the past was OK or seemed OK then and now is no longer needed, because we and our times are better. We may need to consider whether each and every one of our laws and our taboos is really right and needed.

You can change, and you can change society, and I believe no one is negligible. The world history was far from being perfect, but I don't want to have been born in a world where https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith , or even Adolf Hitler, Mao, Stalin, Genghis Khan, or Attila the Hun - there I said that -, etc. were not alive.

Thanks to people like Aristotle or Saladin, the powers of good are smarter, stronger, more ingenious, and more honest, than the powers of Evil which are becoming weaker and more marginal. Geeks/amateurs/action-heros/etc. come in many different shapes and sizes (see this song by Dr. Seuss: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Fish_Two_Fish_Red_Fish_Blue_Fish ). Evil has some variety but it's usually just cynical, skeptical, the belief that we cannot solve most man-made problems, and almost always - wrong. We all have a little bit of cynicism and mysticism, but we should battle it and come out victorious. And no matter how much your life has been unkind to you, these two fine ladies proved that you can still become a superhero:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou

You are probably much more fortunate than either or both of them, so don't mope - cope.

So become a superhero. You are not a nobody. It's time you kick some ass Saladin-style : http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ ( #SummerNSA ).

Also: never give up(!) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE .

Till next time,

Shlomi Fish (a.k.a “Rindolf”)
The Little Red Riding Hood of Messiahs
A heroic person.
Your fan and friend.
