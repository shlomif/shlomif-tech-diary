<h2>I was not trying to advocate Perfectionism</h2>

<p>
Hi!
</p>


<p>
Thanks for your message. One problem I had in my post was that it seemed like I
was advocating perfectionism. As noted in <a
    href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#feeling_good">"Feeling
    Good"</a> (a highly recommended self-help Psychology book about
Cognitive-Behavioural Psychology), Perfectionism is a bad tendency and can
easily lead to many depressions. From what I know of myself, I'm not a
perfectionist and don't ever wish to advocate it. For example, in the Technion,
I had a policy of never trying to improve my grade for a class as long as it
was a passing grade. I even got some 50-something grades and still kept them.
The reason was that I wasn't a perfectionist and that I was trying to
limit the amount of extra frustration and extra work I'll have to endure. I
graduated, and while it cost me a lot of blood, perfectionism would have made
it much worse.

Feeling Good also discusses dealing with guilt, and that you shouldn't feel
bad about your failures. What I meant in my entry is that we should try to
keep some natural, but bad tendencies at bay. One should not worry too much
about having erred, but you should strive not to err too much.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, you need to keep your ideals in context. They are meant to help
you lead a better life, not make you miserable.
</p>

<p>
So I think that when striving for excellence, one should not feel too bad
if he or she errs.
