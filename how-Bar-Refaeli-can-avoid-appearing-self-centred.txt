Title: How to avoid appearing self-centred (w.r.t @BarRefaeli)
==============================================================

Today I'm going to talk about how to avoid looking self-centred. And I'm
going to focus on @BarRefaeli ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Refaeli ;
http://twitter.com/BarRefaeli ), who is the wonderful "alpha female"
of Israel, and is not really self-centred, but certainly appears to be so.

First of all, there is the golem effect between Refaeli and the rest of
Israel (see the opening paragraphs of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect ) where people expect her
to be self-centred and underperform and she thinks people think so in
a malicious cycle. It is up to her to break it.

So how? Here's how:

1. Give performances at IDF military bases.

It is known that she initially got married a short time before her
IDF service, apparently in order to avoid military service (and later
got a divorce). This can be overcome now about 11 years later,
by volunteering to give public performances in IDF bases.

What I'm thinking of her and a few other volunteer soldiers reading various
plays or screenplays using smartphones or tablets - something interactive.
I know for a fact that Israel has far too many budding screenwriters,
and proposed screenplays or plays floating around (and far too fewer talented
people who can produce or direct them), and I believe many (most?) of
them will be extremely happy that Refaeli&co will recite them in front of
a rolling camera.

my own horn.)

2. Donate time and money and be proud of it.

Do you see a street performer whose music you like? What I do if I'm not
in a hurry, is give them a 10 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_new_shekel coin (or more), my
business card (see http://www.shlomifish.org/SFresume.html ), and a 1d10
die (which is my symbol of power), and then try to strike a conversation
with them.

Not only that, but I'm proud of doing that and even proudly tell about that, because
like the Biblical prophet Jeremiah said in http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-23.htm :

«* This is what the LORD says: "Don't let the wise boast in their wisdom, or the powerful boast in their power, or the rich boast in their riches. But those who wish to boast should boast in this alone: that they truly know me and understand that I am the LORD who demonstrates unfailing love and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth, and that I delight in these things. I, the LORD, have spoken!»

Meaning if you do something good and benevolent, it's OK to boast about that. 

It is known that before https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_jobs died there
was no record of him ever donating anything to any charity, however small. However, after he died, I was told that people found him donating quite a
lot of money secretly. But why secretly? Life is too short to keep secrets
people from people, especially about positively benevolent things you do.

Bar should do the same: give her card, a cheap token of power that means
something to her (possibly her signature), and a significant amount of
money (100 sheqels, or 100 U.S. dollars or something like that), and try
to strike a conversation with the street performer. And tell him that she
is Bar Refaeli, and strike a conversation with him.

The same goes for some beggars. I recently gave a beggar 150 sheqels, to
have a conversation with him, and although he was a little self-centred and
wanted to move on to the next "conquest", it was a very good and mostly satisfying experience for me. I also gave a different woman beggar elsewhere
the large remains of my meal which was too large for me to finish, and it
felt good.

Furthermore, also tip gratitiously the same way.

3. Have a conversation with fans and friends in social media outlets:

After visiting Refaeli’s instagram, Twitter, etc. one cannot help get
the impression that she exemplifies Shayqeh Ofir’s English Teacher definition
that "a monologue is one person talking to himself".

(For reference, I mean https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bpVrKm9QCc :
«Shayqeh Ofir - The English Teacher - a short introduction in Hebrew saying "A lesson in a an Arabic school, in the low grades." , and the rest is English mixed with some spoken Arabic.﻿»
- non-Arabic speakers will probably also find it funny, although not get
all subtlety.)

What happens is that she posts something and gets many responses from her fans, and while they sometimes discuss it among themselves, she never replies
to that. What I suggest that she does is dedicate several hours every week
to "blogging" (= writing and replying on the Internet): respond, retweet,
follow interesting people, scold or tactfully evade people who are abusive
- even flirt a little. One doesn't have to reply to each and every reply
or message, but the more you engage in a conversation the relatively
fewer and more quality replies you'll get in a virtuous cycle.

If you do something, do it right.

4. Don't be afraid to live.

As I eventually learned from a great scene from the film https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quick_and_the_Dead_%281995_film%29 (which
is a great film in almost every aspect) a
far worse problem than being afraid to die (which is natural and healthy)
is being afraid to live: to achieve great things, to make friends, to get
hurt, to make mistakes, to be criticised. To truly live your life.

As you may know, my mobile phone number, my E-mail (which has become a disaster area recently so I'd recommend you avoid it for now), my instant messaging credentials, my Reddit, Twitter, Gooogle+ account, etc. are publicly mentioned on my home site, people contact me very rarely.

Why? Because I don't want any random riff-raff to bother me. When someone
contacts me he has a very good reason to do so.

Why does it matter here? Recently someone told me he found a file containing
the phone number of Refaeli and several other supermodels on the darknet. I
told him I'd rather not know it because that would be completely non-kosher.
And I'd bet no one in his right mind will want to call her on that number.

But I would love for more girls and guys to contact me about scheduling
a meeting in a café or restaurant or whatever (and I'm willing to pay
for us both, and even give a souvenir - https://www.flickr.com/photos/shlomif/14354321309/ ). It's highly possible that
