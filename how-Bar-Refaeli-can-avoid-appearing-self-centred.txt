Title: How to avoid appearing self-centred (w.r.t @BarRefaeli)
==============================================================

Today I'm going to talk about how to avoid looking self-centred. And I'm
going to focus on @BarRefaeli ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Refaeli ;
http://twitter.com/BarRefaeli ), who is the wonderful "alpha female"
of Israel, and is not really self-centred, but certainly appears to be so.

First of all, there is the golem effect between Refaeli and the rest of
Israel (see the opening paragraphs of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect ) where people expect her
to be self-centred and underperform and she thinks people think so in
a malicious cycle. It is up to her to break it.

So how? Here's how:

1. Give performances at IDF military bases.

It is known that she initially got married a short time before her
IDF service, apparently in order to avoid military service (and later
got a divorce). This can be overcome now about 11 years later,
by volunteering to give public performances in IDF bases.

What I'm thinking of her and a few other volunteer soldiers reading various
plays or screenplays using smartphones or tablets - something interactive.
I know for a fact that Israel has far too many budding screenwriters,
and proposed screenplays or plays floating around (and far too fewer talented
people who can produce or direct them), and I believe many (most?) of
them will be extremely happy that Refaeli&co will recite them in front of
a rolling camera.
