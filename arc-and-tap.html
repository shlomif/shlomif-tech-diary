<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a> is a new dialect
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language">Lisp</a>
by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> and others. Recently,
Graham has released a working codebase for Arc, which started a small
community of people who play with it and improve it. As part of it, there's
<a href="http://arcfn.com/2008/02/git-and-anarki-arc-repository-brief.html">a
    world-writable version control repository for Arc called "Anarki"</a>.
</p>

<p>
Seeing that a comprehensive test suite was absent, I decided to start writing
one. I decided to use the <a href="http://testanything.org/">Test
    Anything Protocol</a> (or TAP for short), which is a simple-to-implement
STDOUT and STDERR based mechanism for test scripts to emit results of
their test assertions to the TAP harness. This was partly because I expected
the Arc test suite to be written in more than one language, and partly
because I have been involved with the development of
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/">Test::Run</a>,
which is a test harness for TAP, and other TAP efforts, and so wanted
to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one's_own_dog_food">eat my own
    dog food</a>.
</p>

<p>
So I've written (and later on enhanced) a rudimentary implementation of a
TAP emitter in Arc. This TAP emitting module can be found in <tt>arctap.arc</tt>
in the repository, and is used by the Arc tests. Some tests were written
in Perl, primarily to test and fix bugs in the Arc TAP implementation.
The Perl tests use
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::More">Test::More</a>, which
is a TAP-emitting module for Perl, and
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::Trap">Test::Trap</a>.
The latter is used to trap the STDOUT and STDERR of Arc programs that are
run by the Perl scripts. This is done to test the sanity of the Arc
interpreter and the Arc-TAP implementation.
</p>

<p>
So far the work on the test suite uncovered several bugs in Arc and one bug in
Test::Run, and also resulted in some enhancements to Arc. Plus, I was able to
better familiarise myself with Arc, and naturally to write test suite code
which helps in preventing future regressions.
</p>

<p>
One feature of Test::Run that helped here was its
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Run-Plugin-AlternateInterpreters/">AlternateInterpreters
    plugin</a> (which is an idea I originally derived from
something <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ovid/">Curtis "Ovid" Poe</a> (also
a TAP worker) had blogged about). Currently, my <tt>interpreters.conf.yml</tt>
file reads:
</p>

<pre>
---
- cmd: ./arc.sh
  pattern: \.arc(?:\.t)?\z
  type: regex
</pre>

<p>
This uses <tt>./arc.sh</tt> to run the tests by default. The exact configuration
is a bit more complicated
than that (see <tt>Test.sh</tt>), but still the prove utility that
is part of Test-Harness-2.xx, which is the older TAP harness,
would not do. This is because it is impossible to assign a she-bang at the
start of the Arc files, because it seems it confuses the Arc interpreter.
</p>

<p>
Currently 66 assertions in 7 files were written so there's still a long way
for a decent coverage of the Arc features. But so far it seems that using TAP
for the Arc test suite has been a sound choice, and I'm happy with it, and it
probably facilitated putting the test suite together.
