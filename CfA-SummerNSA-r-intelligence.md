1. The screenplay [“Summerschool at the NSA”](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/) (which was written and originally publicised some months before the Snowden revelations fiasco started) is a CC-by-licensed screenplay in which two Hollywood actresses conspired to kick the ass of the United States’ National Security Agency (NSA) using special warfare that is completely non-violent and non-destructive and while making everyone happier as the result. Please read it, and if you like it, recommend it to your friends, and optionally turn it into feature films (including as voiced animated films on YouTube - possibly as individual scenes).

2. If you don't like it, you can either let me know why exactly, and I'll see if I can remedy that in a future version or learn from my mistakes, or you can fork [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/shlomif/Summerschool-at-the-NSA), and create an offshoot on a new branch (the screenplay is CC-by so you are legally allowed to do so, as well as convert to a different the licence).

3. Some more resources are the [NSA “Facts” page](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/) which is also under CC-by and which contains many links and the [more official call-for-action](http://shlomifish.livejournal.com/3001.html) which is also under CC-by, and is sent to some celebrities who are associated with the screenplay (but everyone can read it and contribute to the effort); the [Facebook page about the screenplay](https://www.facebook.com/SummerNSA); the "#SummerNSA" hash tag on social media sites; and the part below about some of the goals that I hope to achieve with the effort.

4. **Note:** I received some antagonism for the orignal fact due to the fact that this story was **fictional**, but one should remember that all good fiction has a solid philosophical basis to it and, even if it's comedy, can convey many serious messages (also see [what Peter Ustinov said about comedy](http://www.quotes-inspirational.com/quote/comedy-simply-funny-way-being-62/). I also noticed that many works of fiction tended to eventually materialise in a way.

There are several goals that I'm trying to achieve with all this:

1. Giving legitamacy to my new format of screenplays, [XML-Grammar-Screenplay](http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/),which once it compiles, can be checked into the version control system and used as is, instead of as the Hollywood blessed format that is extremely hard to get right.

2. Give legitimacy to independent fan fiction, crossovers, Real Person Fiction, remakes, and reboots, some of which have been looked down upon due to the 20th century obsessions with "originality", "professionalism" and "keeping a technical advantage to yourself" (instead of sharing).

3. Finally merge the worlds of the computer industry (including the open source, WWW and Internet workers) , the content/cultural works industry and enthusiasts (including Hollywood, the RIAA, MPAA, YouTube/etc. artists, etc.) and the Academia.

4. Prove to the world that there is a case for "amateurism"/"geekery" (= enjoying what you do or doing it for fun) and that geeks can compete and even surpass professionals.

5. Prove that it is possible to make money, and/or build esteem, recognition and fame from artwork that is under non-"all rights reserved" licences such as the [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons) licences.

6. Help give the case for some [profitable business models](http://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/MRLntf3xu5Y) for creators of online culture, which do not involve ad revenue which is small and has proven to be ineffective. Absent from the post, is selling merchandise (see the famous [“Merchandising”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNZove4OTtI) excerpt from Spaceballs), and putting selected Project Wonderful-like ads, which the web site owner pre-approved of and are non-intrusive. Film makers and artists may wish to deploy them either with “Summerschool at the NSA” or with different cultural works.
