<h2>2011-04-25: Praise</h2>

<p>
In the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggadah_of_Pesach">Passover Haggadah</a>,Jews are instructed to praise (and lots of other mostly synonyms that
sound funny in modern Hebrew, and are beyond my limited English
vocabulary - I could look up the translation, but I'm too lazy) God for
doing all the good on their ancestors as described in the Biblical story
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus">the
Exodus from Egypt</a>, and in later books of the Bible. I'm not a religious
or observant Jew, and Passover is almost over (it's the second holiday now),
but I think it'd be a good idea to "praise" people, communities,
technologies etc. because while we have a lot of stuff to rant about and
criticise, praise and raves give a better feeling and should be done more
often.
</p>

<p>
So in this raves/recommendations/praise article, I will give some praise for
stuff I encountered recently. Here goes:
</p>

<h3>The Clojure community</h3>

<p>
Seeing that <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is the most currently
trendy modern Lisp dialect out there (and being a Java Virtual Machine-based
language was actually usable), I joined its mailing list and
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/e7cedcb1e8dbb6dd">offered
a 200 USD bounty</a> for implementing a command line scripting tool based on
it, citing several places. While no one stepped to implement it, the response
was extremely friendly: no one told me that "scripting was bad", or that there
is no such thing as "throwaway code", or that
Mark Jason Dominus/Joel on Software/Paul Graham/Larry Wall/Aristotle/whoever
were speaking nonsense. They said they'd love to have a command line scripting
in Lips, that Clojure was probably not the right tool for the job due to the
JVM, and someone gave me constructive criticism that I should have offered
a T-shirt and/or buying-a-beverage-or-meal-of-your-choice, because when
offering money, then people get bitter about how large the sum is.
