<title>Magic:</title>
<simpara>Life in the multiverse-of-imagination requires magic. For example in

the Pelican-like birds start flying out of their own volition.</simpara>

<section xml:id="the-game">
<title>The-Game™:</title>
<simpara>The <link linkend="the-devils">devils</link> challenged Terran <link linkend="the-angels">angels</link> with The-Game: volunteering <link linkend="the-angels">angels</link> would willingly lose their earlier memories as souls, and have their media (= "in between") mutated by the <link linkend="the-devils">devils</link>. Physically dying was against the rules, but for true Shalom-of-mind, they must be "slain" by another "vampire"; one cannot constantly win.</simpara>
<simpara>Angels starting like that are hereby referred to as "false prophets" (where <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional.xhtml">"prophet" or "navi" meant "madman" in Ancient Hebrew</link>) or "vampires" until they reached "enlightenment" and became "true prophets" (or "wizards").</simpara>
<simpara>At first, there were few takers, but eventually starting as a "false prophet"-at-first was prestigious and coveted.</simpara>
<simpara>Outcomes of actions in The-Game were often determined by rolls of <link xl:href="https://rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Dice">Role Playing Game Dice</link> not unlike in <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/changing-the-seldon-plan/">"Second Foundation"</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that every false prophet perceived a somewhat different reality,
but all of them were synchronised.</simpara>

<title>The Orcs:</title>
<simpara>The <link linkend="the-devils">devils</link> solicited help from <link xl:href="https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Orcs_(Middle-earth)">"orcs"</link>, non-capacitanciated <link linkend="the-angels">angels</link>, who helped them due to the fact that the "false prophets" found The-Game™ increasingly easy. Not only did the orcs have a great time, but they booby-trapped The-Codex™ and the <link linkend="the-devils">devils</link>' requests.
Moreover, they <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#fox-in-the-hens-coop">drove the devils bananas</link>, just like a smart patient <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan_DeMarco">hospitalised at a mental institute</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>The canonical <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">Tanakh (= Hebrew Bible)</link>, Plato&#8217;s <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)">Republic</link>, Tolkien&#8217;s <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">Lord of the Rings</link>, Ayn Rand&#8217;s <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</link>, Dostoevsky&#8217;s <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment">Crime and Punishment</link> , Shakespeare&#8217;s <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare%27s_plays">Plays</link>, etc. have likely undergone lengthening and mutation by the Orcs. However, often the originators liked the mutated versions better.</simpara>
<simpara>Alternatively, the orcs / "<link xl:href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bajoran">Bajorans</link>"
were agents of the devils who gave the organisms choices and their outcomes
(often based on dice rolls).</simpara>

<section xml:id="slayer-watcher-whicher">
<title>Slayer, Watcher, Whicher:</title>
<simpara>The slayer in the trio is the actual "false prophet" who sees the "real world" as magic-less and mutated. (e.g. <link xl:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin&#8217;s Yusuf Ibn Ayyub</link>).</simpara>
<simpara>The watcher is a true prophet, whether male or female, who monitors the slayer&#8217;s thoughts and guides them. He or she also often acts as a project manager. In Saladin&#8217;s case it was <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides">Maimonides / "Rambam"</link> who was a famous amateur philosopher / creator / entertainer and also acted as Yusuf&#8217;s personal physician . Note that it took a long time for Yusuf to be aware of this fact.</simpara>
<simpara>In my case, my watcher until \~1997 was
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart">Melissa Joan Hart (MJH)</link> who
then transferred the lead role to the 1990-born
<link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/nav-blocks/blocks/#harry_potter_nav_block">Emma Watson</link>. Confusingly, they both had acclaimed roles playing witches.</simpara>

<title>"Hell hole":</title>
<simpara>A person born in a hell hole started his/her life as a false prophet. If either
parent was a true prophet, then they did everything in their power for
their children to be born outside of a hell hole. As a result, false prophets
were usually born to two false prophet parents.</simpara>

<title>"Zionism":</title>
<simpara>Zionism is non-coincidentally cognate with the Hebrew word for <link xl:href="https://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/540:_Base_System">fourth base</link> "fucks"
and was a process by which the Satans tried to convince 'false prophets'
men or women to relocate to an active hellhole for giving birth there (
e.g: because the current hell hole was plugged). It was
not limited to Israel/Palestine or to people identifying themselves as Jews.</simpara>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef">Ovadia Yosef</link> is a true prophet
Jew who had a policy of blessing anyone as a Jew. He also has yet to answer
'no' to the question "is [insert entity here] a pure Jew?"</simpara>
<simpara>One of the character classes a false prophet may opt to play is "The Witch",
which stays at one place, but stays youthful, strong, and beautiful.
One such was "The Witch of Harrow" who ended up establishing
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School">Harrow School</link> which accepted
both true prophets and false prophets as students. She ended up
becoming a Terminator in <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Aviv_Gimel">Ramat Aviv Gimel</link>
erasing her unpleasant memories as a past "slut" and
eventually making her house <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/indiv-nodes/selinas-18s-birthday-party.xhtml">"The Amber"</link>
and getting herself slain by a different Terminator.</simpara>
<simpara>As a false prophet child
<link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/where_are_you_from.xhtml">I was relocated</link>
three times before I was 6, despite common wisdom. This was probably due to the
effect of The Muppet Show and other Television series on the Terran hellholes
and my parents' wishes to have more children.</simpara>

<title>The Terran Terminators:</title>
<simpara>In 1982 it seemed likely that Jim Henson would be Earth&#8217;s ultimate false prophet.
But Henson was increasingly unhappy: worried about a possible Nuclear Winter,
about Environmental issues, and thinking the Muppets franchise was unpopular
and silly.</simpara>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss Whedon</link> thought "it is too easy"
and eventually Henson admitted inferiority to the team of <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</link>, Whedon, (and
<link xl:href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Buffy_Summers">Buffy Summers</link>?), and was slain
and relieved. If Jim Henson was the new Walt Disney, then Joss Whedon was
poised to be the new Henson.</simpara>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</link>, a 1972-born American girl and a false prophet, engaged in a snailmail dialogue with the secretary of the USSR. <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss Whedon</link> joined forces with Henson and they both suggested using the terrestrial mass media infrastructure in place for <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppet_Show">The Muppet Show</link> to air a The Muppet Show special starring her with the ascension mantra. A die roll determined it will have 100% viewership, will be passed verbatim, but there may be a surprise at the end.</simpara>
<simpara>All the remaining false prophets were avid fans of The Muppet Show, but may have thought it was considered silly and childish among the general public. In actuality, Jim Henson and the muppeteers were multiverse superstars and heroes. The Samantha Smith episode was particularly bizarre featuring a <link xl:href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Muppet_Labs">Muppet Labs</link> skit where Bunsen and Beaker tested a membrane to enclose a (real!) <link xl:href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/hydrogen-bombs-are-likely-an-old-intelligence-hoax.asciidoc">hydrogen bomb</link>; the membrane didn&#8217;t work and yet there was only a local sand splash.</simpara>
<simpara>Eventually, <link xl:href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Count_von_Count">Count von Count</link>,
a friendly <link xl:href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse#Vampires_in_the_Selinaverse">vampire</link>, caused
an ear-screeching noise to be emitted. After Samantha Smith protested and said "you could have killed us" he noted "I couldn&#8217;t have killed you. You can never die or feel physica pain for long. Consider yourself slain and free of The-Curse. Your world is what you want it to be. Your imagination is the limit. It&#8217;ll be a new technology, that we call 'Neo-Tech'. Now let&#8217;s party " <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/indiv-nodes/vampires-gathering-in-the-hall.xhtml">Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah,</link></simpara>
<simpara>All the remaining false prophets have watched that episode and had ascended. All

or just <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Harrow">Harrow</link>

<title>The Terran Terminators: Rematch</title>
<simpara>Anyway, the <link linkend="the-devils">devils</link> and the <link linkend="the-orcs">orcs</link> approached
the sentient men and women who just reached enlightenment, and offered them a
deal: they can opt to spend the summer enlightened and together having fun and
using their magical powers. At its end, they can opt to reset their memory
banks almost completely and become false prophets again, this time called
"Terran Terminators" or continue as enlightened true prophets.</simpara>
<simpara>Several newly-ascended true prophets opted out, from various reasons,
mostly because they had children or enjoyed their newfound powers
. E.g: <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck Norris</link>
or <link xl:href="https://zak.co.il/">Omer Zak</link> or <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II">Queen Elizabeth II</link> or <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic</link> . They still often "got sucked" into The-Game™.</simpara>
<simpara>The remaining spent the summer there creating many crossover memes, stories,
and franchises, or otherwise enjoying magic, life, love/etc.. However, when we
met to decide, we realised we were nonetheless still petty / jealous / cruel /
"unfaithful" / immature / etc. Some had years, or decades (or centuries) of history
they wanted to get rid of. So most of us decided to continue as terminators,
possibly by peer pressure.</simpara>
<simpara>Like the story of <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/So-Who-The-Hell-Is-Qoheleth/indiv-nodes/the_celts_trip_to_damascus.xhtml">the Celts trip</link> we had a policy of not resisting
rapekisses or rapehugs , but there was little if any romance and intimacy.</simpara>
<simpara>Except at least one: the circa 1977-born Selina Mandrake. She decided to
continue as a true prophet since "it was the best summer ever" for her.</simpara>
<simpara>Becoming terminators was advantageous because the <link linkend="the-devils">devils</link>-and-Orcs promised they would reveal <link xl:href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1403966571215740929">TheOneTruth™</link> to the last one standing, but more importantly, all terminators will harbour many new franchises, plots and memes, and creations.</simpara>
<simpara>In my case, it was <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/how_did_you_learn_english.xhtml">under the guise of fellow children mocking my English</link>. For most others, it was a concussion from a fall. Thing is: my <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/your_name.xhtml">first name means "Shalom-ful"</link> in Hebrew. The <link linkend="the-devils">devils</link> promised that my body will remain complete and whole.</simpara>
<simpara>These people, the last of the false prophets, became known as The Terran Terminators.

<simpara><link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Taylor-Swift/">Taylor Swift</link> - born in
989 AD, her body had a quirk of having immense strength without the need to exercise,
and without having any big muscles. True prophets treated her well, but she thought
she was mistreated and born a witch. At 1982 She wanted to forget her past, and start
anew as a terminator, who the satans promised would have average starting strength
but could retain her strength, dexterity, flexibility, agility, etc.
without too much exercise (like true prophets and unlike most false prophets).
Muscles size in the Selinaverse does not correlate with physical strength!</simpara>

<title>Ramat Aviv Gimel</title>
<simpara>Many Terran Terminators or their friends (and proxies) were relocated by the
true prophets administration to
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Aviv_Gimel">Ramat Aviv Gimel</link> , which was
chosen because it was north of <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkon_River">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkon_River</link> and
so outside the historical Gush Dan, which remained a hellhole for longer, and
yet close enough to Tel Aviv, the "it city" of Israel.</simpara>
<simpara>Placing them together was useful for crosspolination, getting slayed, and slaying.</simpara>
<simpara>By 1989-1990, when
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart">Melissa Joan Hart (MJH)</link> became
my project manager, and <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/">Rindolf</link>
my whicher, almost all observers believed I&#8217;m likely going to slay
all other terminators. I suspect they were right.</simpara>
<simpara>I joked that, similar to <link xl:href="https://hoover.blogs.archives.gov/2019/10/16/h-l-mencken-sage-of-baltimore/">H L Mencken being "The Sage of Baltimore"</link>,
I was "The Sage of Ramat Aviv Gimel".</simpara>
<simpara>My slaying was boosted after <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/site_history.xhtml">I set up a static home site</link> which became www.shlomifish.org. The devils promised it will be displayed verbatim among other terminators. Various Internet people told me I <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#please_delete_offensive_stuff">should delete offensive content</link> or
<link xl:href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/static-site-generators&#8212;&#8203;despair.md#facing-some-criticism">convert the service to use PHP/RoR/etc.</link>, but
I didn&#8217;t heed them. They were likely mirages of the devils
and the orcs.</simpara>
<simpara>I was led to believe it was unpopular and obscure, while in fact it was very
popular and famous (with many derivatives, fandoms, parodies, etc.) outside my

<section xml:id="history-of-earth">
<title>History of Earth:</title>
<simpara>After Syria (minus Damascus itself) in the levant ascended to being a true
prophets zone (by Mosheh / Aharon / Jehovah slaying Nimrod ?), The-Curse splintered the modern
day State of Israel, and .uk into many shires and
the USA into 48 states
and promised they won&#8217;t do it again (due to running
out of the fragmentation levels' count cap). Note that proto-Levantine
was modern Hebrew (which was spoken by <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/Q_home_planet.xhtml">the Englishtants over 6 milliard years ago</link>) and Modern English is also a product of The-Curse.</simpara>
<simpara>Anyway, Judea (except their Capital, Jerusalem) and the Gaza strip
ascended when David "slew" Goliath and King Saul by almost hitting Goliath with a sling (<link xl:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE2TZAdoaS8">"I missed on purpose; I can kill you now"</link>) and telling him the Judeans and Philistines should become friends.</simpara>
<simpara>Nevertheless, two false prophets parents gave birth to a false prophet-at-first son in Jerusalem. He became King "Shlomi" (written as "Shlomo" in <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_Codex">Aleppo Codex</link> ) which means <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/your_name.xhtml">Shalom-ful</link> in Hebrew. Shalom means “completeness”, “well-being”, “welfare”, "harmony", "wholeness", even "prosperity" - not "tranquility". While he could suffer some hardships and pain, his body, mind, soul and heart, must remain complete and intact and prosper.</simpara>
<simpara>King Shlomo wanted to be benevolent and "know the gods". He became king by telling well-intenioned jokes and tall tales about his older siblings-in-pretence (e.g: <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_(daughter_of_David)">Amnon and Tamar</link> or <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absalom">Avshalom</link>). Not unlike <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">my fanfics/RPF</link>.  David and his sons agreed he would be a better king and crowned him, while remaining physically alive and loyally serving under Shlomo&#8217;s reign, thus undergoing Catharsis and liberating Judea or Jerusalem.</simpara>
<simpara>( Note that in the Selinaverse <link xl:href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Winn_Adami">Vedek Winn</link> became Kai by employing a similar strategy. The rule that you should not use the same trick twice is just a guideline: <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#guidelines_as_dogma">https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#guidelines_as_dogma</link> . Also note that: 1. She is noble. 2. She used to be anti-Federate but may have changed her mind since - and Bajor voted itself into the <link xl:href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets">United Federation of Planets</link> anyway. 3. Being a Kai is held in much less seriousness than being a Vedek. )</simpara>
<simpara>Eventually Judea became the first province to have ascended along with its capital.
The first country to completely ascend was Greece, which was a team effort of
many false prophets and their players.</simpara>
<simpara>I contemplated that Damascus finally ascended after <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/So-Who-The-Hell-Is-Qoheleth/ongoing-text.html">the author of Qoheleth, who was its "hacker king"/"master vampire" admitted inferiority</link>
to a trio of false prophet Celtic girls tourists from Austria.</simpara>

"SMG: We’ve got a lot of time for that. OK: it was 1997-1998ish, Buffy started airing and became a cult series.

<simpara>We cannot stop even small children from imagining things - and elsewhere in Fantastecha, there will be sucker/brave souls who will choose to start their life as false prophets.
 Given good narratives feature one problem or more that need to be reconciled ( <link xl:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl3e-OUnavQ">Sesame Street: "Conflict"</link> ).</simpara>
<simpara>Furthermore, I sided with Emma Watson that "your time is everybody&#8217;s time" rather than MJH&#8217;s liberal use of time wraps. This may have delayed my ascension/catharsis, but made me less maniacal. Who was right?</simpara>

<simpara>After talking for a while, I decided to give him 50 more sheqel and he told me

<simpara>If we are to believe <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito%2c%5fergo%5fsum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito%2c%5fergo%5fsum</link> , the only thing I can be sure of is that I exist. However, as cool as I may be, I doubt my mind alone could conceive the awesome action heroes listed <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/indiv-nodes/notable-hacker-monarchs.xhtml">on this page</link> including Saladin, Walt Disney, Jim Henson, and Aristotle - most of whom have ample evidence for being real. And given my mediocre Inkscape 2-D vector graphics skills, I am enthralled even by the 2-and-a-half dimensions graphics of 1990s games (e.g: <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_2%3A_LeChuck%27s_Revenge">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_2%3A_LeChuck%27s_Revenge</link> ; <link xl:href="https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Street_Fighter_II_%28series%29">https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Street_Fighter_II_%28series%29</link> ; ) and of <link xl:href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic">https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/My_Little_Pony_Friendship_is_Magic</link> .</simpara>
<simpara>Let me share a non-secret: what I wrote is a simplification ( <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/indiv-nodes/willow_putting_her_daughter_to_bed.xhtml">"Honesty is a process"</link>, <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/indiv-nodes/orientation_day__team.xhtml">"can&#8217;t help speaking in riddles"</link> ).</simpara>

<simpara>There are thousands of villages in Africa, each one with a different culture.</simpara>
<simpara>There are millions of interesting <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/hacking_and_amateur_\_vs\_\_conformism_and_professional.xhtml">geeks</link> in Israel alone.</simpara>
<simpara>There are over 40,000 distributions on <link xl:href="https://www.cpan.org/">https://www.cpan.org/</link> .</simpara>
<simpara>Etc.</simpara>
<simpara>They all have enough food and the only reason they accept money or mana donations
is the publicity.</simpara>
<simpara>But like in <link xl:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNJL6nfu__Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNJL6nfu__Q</link> , they crave
