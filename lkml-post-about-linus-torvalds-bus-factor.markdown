Hi all,

hope you had a great weekend, and a happy upcoming
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah .

this is written as a continuation to these two posts:

* http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/linus-torvalds-bus-factor/

* http://zgp.org/pipermail/linux-elitists/2012-March/013387.html

First of all I'd like to apologise for the way I conveyed my message in the
original post, which I now realise was too flammatory. That put aside, banning
me from sending email to all the lists on @vger.kernel.org was uncalled for,
and it certainly wasn't acceptable for the E-mail admin to ignore my requests
to get the banned lifted.

And here's the thing: the reason I was outcast so badly was not because I was
lying, but quite the opposite: because I uncovered an Elephant in the Room (
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room ), which is a big truth
that people refuse to acknowledge. For more about this, see:

( You can block this address too, but you'll only further validate my point.)

So what I suggest is:

1. Linus (Torvalds) should quit being the kernel benevolent dictator
for now and instead do better and more profitable
things with his time than shepherd a large number of kernel developers and
contributors and review each and every git commit. He is a superstar and
should act this way.

What Linus can do instead is:

1.1. Travel the world, giving talks at conventions (or "conferences"), possibly
while charging money or a lot of money for his public talks, or collecting
donations in a hat.

1.2. Give interviews for Reddit (I Am X - ask me anything), talk shows (
e.g: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show ),
newspapers and magazines, etc. He may charge money for them too.

1.3. Dedicate some time for acquiring other useful skills, including learning
more areas of software development.

2. Please consider having more than one committer to a single central
git repository.

3. With respect to
http://www.itworld.com/software/365342/linus-torvalds-too-abusive-linux-kernel-mailing-list ,
the woman who complained on LKML that they should be more tactful and friendly
was right.

Geeks can be more tactful and friendly without becoming less competent (
it's a false dichotomy).

Linus later accused her of being “passive-aggressive” (whatever that means)
but he was wrong. She was honest and brave.
