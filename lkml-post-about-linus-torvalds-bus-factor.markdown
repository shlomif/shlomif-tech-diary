Hi all,

hope you had a great weekend, and a happy upcoming
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah .

this is written as a continuation to these two posts:

* http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/linus-torvalds-bus-factor/

* http://zgp.org/pipermail/linux-elitists/2012-March/013387.html

First of all I'd like to apologise for the way I conveyed my message
in the original post, which I now realise was too flammatory. That put aside,
banning me from sending email to all the lists on @vger.kernel.org was uncalled
for, and it certainly wasn't acceptable for the E-mail admin to ignore my requests
to get the banned lifted.

And here's the thing: the reason I was outcast so badly was not because I was lying,
but quite the opposite: because I uncovered an Elephant in the Room ( see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room ), which is a big truth that people
refuse to acknowledge. For more about this, see:

( You can block this address too, but you'll only further validate my point.)

So what I suggest is:

1. Linus (Torvalds) should quit
