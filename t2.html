<h2>2009-01-14: Shavin' Another Second</h2>

<p>
I've been working on <a
href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/File-Find-Object/">File-Find-Object</a>
for quite some time now. File-Find-Object provides an alternative to
File::Find, which is a built-in module in the perl 5 distribution, with
several major philosophical limitations. What both modules do is traverse
a directory tree and allow the programmer to do something with all the
results, similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find">the Unix shell
"find" command</a>.
</p>

<p>
My obsession with working on File-Find-Object started
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2006/03/msg110263.html">in
this perl5-porters thread</a>, where I also claimed that File::Find was
probably IO-Bound, and so making it iterative and capable of instantiation
(which is partially what File-Find-Object is all about), will not harm
its performance much. As it turns out, I was not entirely right.
</p>

<p>
About two weeks ago, I decided to finally benchmark File-Find-Object. The
original motivation for this was a small change I did and perceived as an
optimisation in which I reduced the number of hard-disk-reading system calls
that it used to a minimum. I wrote a few shell scripts that timed the
old version of F-F-O versus the new one on my <tt>~/progs</tt> sub-directory (which
is contains many sub-directories), after it was in turn traversed by the
"find" command.
</p>

<p>
Both version took somewhat over 2 minutes to complete the scan, which seemed
pretty good to me. However, when I benchmarked a similar script using
File::Find, I found out that it finished the scan in under 5 seconds, making
it 24 times faster than File-Find-Object. I didn't want F-F-O to be so much
worse, so I decided to work on optimising it.
</p>

<p>
My methodology in optimising File-Find-Object was to profile it using
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/perl-devel-nytprof/">Devel::NYTProf</a>
(the Perl profiler with the best reputation, and one which I can now
recommend as well), find problematic spots, try to optimise them, and
then benchmark the old code against the new to see if there were any
improvements, and if so - commit.
</p>

<p>
Among the notable changes I performed were:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
The first thing I noticed was that a lot of time was spent in Class::Accessor
code. To remedy this, I switched to
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-XSAccessor/">Class-XSAccessor</a>,
which resulted in saving 40 seconds of runtime. The other changes I made
were less substantial individually in terms of run-time saving.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Added a flag to <tt>$self</tt> (the object instance) with whether the
stack of the directories in which the traversal is in progress, is full
or not. It was used inside several dynamically-generated functions where I
delegate to top and non-top versions.
</p>

<p>
To save some extra speed, the flag is checked using
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/exists.html">exists</a> which
should be a bit faster.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Saved 2.5 seconds of run-time by implementing a commonly used function
(that was reported to consume a lot of time) in a direct manner, instead
of the top/non-top delegation, and using some judicious optimisation using
the "||" operator.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Saved many seconds on eliminating calls to <tt>_copy</tt> methods that
flat-copy array refs (and are also generated dynamically). Often, the
copying was not needed at all.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Eliminated excessive calls to
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/File/Spec.html">File::Spec</a>'s
functions by caching the results.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
For each node, File-Find-Object performs two actions in a specific order
depending on the "depth" instance-wide parameter. Previously, handling them
involved weird returns of arrays, and indexes-mangling (which I admit that
I originally implemented in my endless refactoring). This was changed
to a simple array of method names, from which values are extracted.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Re-arranged the order of operations to prevent an
<tt>if (_is_top()) { ... }</tt> conditional, that was done in every iteration.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Originally, the main object served as the controlling object for the top
directory, and <tt>dir_stack-&gt;[0]</tt> was the directory below it. So
when checking for fatherhood of a directory, one had to return the main
object for the father of <tt>dir_stack-&gt;[0]</tt>. In a series of commits, I
moved it to be a separate object, as well as occupying the first step
in the directory stack.
</p>

<p>
As a result, I was able to cache the "_current" object inside an accessor,
because doing so in for the main object before would have resulted in a
circular reference, which would have caused a memory leak.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thanks to all these optimisations, File-Find-Object now runs at
about 30-40 seconds.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I also benchmarked the first version of File-Find-Object
before I took over its maintenance, and started refactoring it, and
it runs at 17 seconds for the same test.
</p>

<p>
So what are the <b>Conclusions</b>?
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Accessors in Perl may incur a large overhead if Class::XSAccessor (or similar)
are not used.
</li>

<li>
Extracting methods excessively can incur a heavy penalty on performance of
Perl programs.
</li>

<li>
Traversing a directory in Perl can be very CPU-bound.
</li>

<li>
4. Many small optimisations can together yield a huge benefit. In
<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/222">this
message to the fc-solve-discuss mailing list</a>, Bill Raymond says
that "I achieved my fast times by multitudes of 1% reductions". I can
attest to it here.
</li>
</p>
</ol>

<p>
As indicated by the benchmarks, the road to a faster File-Find-Object
is not over, and I still have some ideas for improvements in mind. But
it's still much better than it used to be, and I can be proud of it.
</p>

<p>
The title of this post was inspired by Ido Trivizki's
<a href="http://www.perl.org.il/YAPC/2004/talk.html?id=23">"Shavin' another
bit" presentation</a> given at YAPC::Israel::2004, and which I attended
and enjoyed.
