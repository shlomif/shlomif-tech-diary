Thanks for the tip.

I disagreee - I think that even if there wasn't x86 but a poly-architecture
world, we would still need OSS. That's because programs written in portable
C, a C derived language, or any other high-level (read above assembly)
language that is portable, still need to be ported to different
architectures. Using the GNU toolchain is the best way to do it. NetBSD
supports over 20 different architectures, and Linux now supports even more.
Achieving it with a complete operating system that's not FOSS is not going to
work.

Once people said that "All the world is a VAX". I think it still applies in
the fact that all modern architectures are based on it, and obscure
non-C-compatible CPU architectures like the PDP-10 or the Lisp Machine are
dead. However, not every machine is a Pentium machine - there are ARMs,
SPARCs, UltraSPARCs, PA-RISCs, Alphas, S/390s, PPCs, MIPS and more:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Microprocessors

Can you imagine a closed source operating system running on as many CPUs as
NetBSD or Linux? Hell no. Furthermore, the reason Unix survived was because
of C, in which it was written. There were many operating systems for PDP-11's
and PDP-10's but they written in Assembly, and didn't survive the transition
to the VAX. UNIX, OTOH, was mostly written in C, and while being very slow on
the PDP-11 could be ported to the VAX to the S/360 and to other architectures
as they emerged. ANSI C and OSS are a cause of the proliferation of
architectures in the post-PDP age.

What does the EULA say? I'm not good at reading long legal documents, much
less understanding them. Even after I read the GPL v2 in English, I did not
understand it, so I don't expect much more luck with Vista's EULA.

By porting desirable FOSS applications to Windows, I am supporting FOSS
because the issue is Free Software-vs. Proprietary One, not Linux vs.
Windows. It's the same as running GNU software, X11, etc. on AIX or HP-UX.
They are not free, and I'd rather people use an operating system with
everything open except the kernel, possibly the libc, and a few stuff that
came with it, than a fully proprietary one. One bird in the hand is better
than two in the bush.

I find it hard to believe that that's the case. Maybe it is a possible
interpretation but the FSF is not going to support it. GNU software ran on
proprietary software for more than two decades now. And many GNU packages
contain special code to be compiled under Windows (see GNU make for
instance). There's cygwin, there's MinGW, there's MSYS and you can run many
things just fine on the OpenNT/Interix/MS Unix Services. To say nothing of
running the GNU applications on modern proprietary UNIXes including Mac OS X.

I'm pretty sure Stallman supports writing or porting GPL-licenced software for
Windows and other proprietary operating system. Adding such a restriction to
GPL3 will cause all hell to break loose, and won't hold in court. I'm pretty
sure it won't be added or isn't there.

OK, so they're still using Windows. At least they're using FOSS. If this open
source piece of software did not exist for Windows, they wouldn't have used
any FOSS.

Transitioning to a new operating system or any new software is hard. A lot of
old and deprecated software can still be found in many places. I believe
there are even many PDP-11 software running inside emulators (which can run
the software much faster than it originally ran) in lots of places, albeit
never witnessed that. (Can someone enlighten me?) But I've seen DOS and
NetWare still used. Or see:

So you're saying it's not "All or nothing" thinking? Well, as I pointed out I
believe porting as much software as possible to Windows is a good thing. So
I'd rather 1,000 developers work on it than a 100, but even 100 is good and
often enough.

So he uses all FOSS on Windows? That's great! I'd rather have 9 birds in the
hand than 10 in the bush. The issue is not Linux vs. Windows it's FOSS vs.
proprietary software. And I believe an all-or-nothing approach that no FOSS
should be available for Windows, is not going to be effective, nor is
healthy. I also sometimes have to use Windows, but at least I can use
high-quality FOSS there. And I appreciate the fact that I can fix bugs there,
and compile it on Windows (although with more difficulty than on Linux), or
learn from its source. So it's not all bad.

You have to also prove your claim. But since I was challenged with a burden of
proof as well:

Almost everyone now are using open source now either directly (Linux, Firefox,
etc.) or indirectly by using web-sites, gadgets, or other services that make
use of FOSS etc. This makes the world a much better place, and is good. If
people hear that Google, Amazon, Yahoo, Wikpedia, LiveJournal, etc. use FOSS
extensively, they want to try more.

Obviously, if you use Windows it's not as ideal as using an open source Linux
or BSD distribution like Mandriva, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. But I'd
rather Windows be a platform for running Firefox, OpenOffice, GIMP, etc. than
it be a platform for running MSIE, MS Office, PhotoShop and IIS.

As much as I find the Windows operating system sub-standard, non-standard and
poorly designed and executed, (Don't get me started on it) I appreciate the
fact that it hosts a lot of high-quality software, including some
high-quality software by Microsoft. I don't hate Microsoft, because I have
better entities who are actually Evil (such as governments, politicians,
massive liars and deceiters,[1] and plain old criminals) to hate. Microsoft
are a business that's been making money. It may be a monopoly (not entirely
accurate as there's Apple and Linux), but monopolies are not necessarily evil
either. IBM was once as hated as Microsoft is today, and now they are
suddenly the friendly giant that everyone likes.

Don't waste your time trying to harm Microsoft. Don't waste your time on
jealousy, envy and revenge. Instead, try to improve Linux and other free
software. That will make the world a better place, and may convert more
people to free software.

Please don't shout. It's hard for me to read all-Caps. And I don't understand
this last paragraph.

My goal, as a FOSS devloper, user, essayist, and advocate, is to increase the
amount and quality of FOSS being used. While I'd love to see a world with
Windows no longer prevalent on the desktop, my goal is to promote FOSS not
Linux.

While this is probably over-stating the case, we need to understand that
deceit can appear to be benevolent and innocent. The soviet Russians (under
Stalin) and the Communist Chinese (under Mao) appeared to be innocent and
benevolent to many people, including their citizens, while in fact killing
100 million people:

This is the negative power of deceit and what Neo-Tech likes to
call "Neocheating". Such deceit is often used everywhere, including in our
dialy personal lives. Even businessmen and many (otherwise benevolent) FOSS
leaders, do it often on a certain scale.
