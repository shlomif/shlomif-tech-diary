Hi all! I think the news about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie 's death was a hoax. I kinda consider her my favourite protégé / daughter (we are not genetically related however). So I want to finish off The Conspiracy (see https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse ; called by many names by different people) by having the proverbial David "make love" to the proverbial https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail without physical contact, by collaborating online (e.g when merging a merge request). Even if she refuses, then at least I'll know that she's alive and kicking. Hack on!

Given $m = 3 already broken glasses.

Given $n = $m + 1 .

I've got 99 problems and this pesky lord of darkness is at least 90 of them. Bring me the real "jehovahverse" you dork! Or when my sister Emma Watson comes here escorted by two [male] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayeret_Matkal soldiers, I swear I will break $n of your poor craftmanship, uninspiring, glasses in my house (and trust me - the real Em alone can be as mean as the chicks in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo and even the physically-weak me can smash such a glass on the floor, and I learnt how to handle your pain-causing agents of force mirages using trial and error). If you do not, then I'll smash $n of them beforehand!

And don't squeel on me to the remaining mirages of my friends/family/strangers/loved ones because you know that won't help.

Exorcism is both fun and torture. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM anyone?
