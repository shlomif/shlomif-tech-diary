I had to learn Perl 5 and some popular unix flavours at the time back in 1996ish when I [started working for Cortext web design](https://www.shlomifish.org/prog-evolution/shlomif-at-cortext.html). Back then I recall downloading and building the sources of a lot of [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) and other software, but not really aware of the legal qualities of libre software. We also used [mSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSQL) which had viewable source, but not FOSS.

Anyway, since I liked unix-like OSes so much I installed Red Hat Linux  locally. I'm not sure of the exact chronological order, but I:

1. Wrote the [gradient-fu patch for GIMP](https://www.shlomifish.org/grad-fu/) which had to be reworked several times before it was incorporated (which it was finally and thankfully).

2. Started the failed ["Gamla" project](https://www.shlomifish.org/Iglu/shlomif/gamla/) which failed in part because I haven't written a working Proof-of-Concept beforehand (see http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/ for why it was a bad idea).

3. Wrote and released version 0.2 of [Freecell Solver](https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/) and announced it on [Freshmeat/Freecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freecode), which first was licensed under the [public domain](http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Licensing_and_Law/public-domain.html) and much later was converted to use the MIT licence. This proved to be one of my most popular projects. It has been interesting maintaining an app that many users (including many non-programmers or laymen) try to use on Windows, macos, and lately - many mobile devices.
