Hi,

I decided to top-post - hope it’s OK, and I’m also sending it to you in
private, but I’m going to post it on my Google+ and Facebook accounts.

well, this message of yours is a bit TL;DRy (= Too Long;Didn’t Read-y). In any
case, from now on, I’ll try to:

1. Only send messages to the list (not CCing the recipient).

2. Try to be really tactful and constrained (I can get carried away and use a
lot of pseudo-emotional “Love you” , “(♥!)”, etc. stuff that is common on
IRC/etc. but may not work too well in E-mail.).

3. I see people who criticise either me or even my messages in a private message
to the owner as a personal offense, because such E-mails should be made in the
open, so I and other people can learn from it, instead of being an appeal to
authority. The Jewish scholars believed that the second temple was destroyed
due to a similar behaviour:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamsa_and_Bar_Kamsa

The story tells of a man who appealed to the Roman emperor for an insult
of his enemy, instead of being the better man and holding a similar feast
for honoring his, hopefully former, enemy and for making peace with him. See:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Heaven_%28film%29 .

I also can receive any such E-mails in private.

4. Being on gendergap does not mean that much to me.

5. I tend to be carried away and be less reserved and controlled when being in
a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania (which is otherwise quite an
enjoyable feeling).

6. You can try telling people to behave in a more stoic manner towards me and
other offenders - see http://unarmed.shlomifish.org/1747.html - and there’s
also the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect vs. the opposite “Golem
effect”, which are insightful.

7. A lot of people feel that the way I sexualise or idealise members of the
opposite sex (= “MOTOS”) is sexist, but I agree with Ayn Rand that it is part
of the integral way of feeling about competence, strength and ability.

What I disagree with her is that it should necessary mean actually getting into
a sexual/etc. relationship with this object of attraction. A man or a
woman in a relationship (including marriage) are perfectly allowed to be
attracted to other MOTOS, but succumbing to this is usually unwise.

7.a) I think too many *cynical* feminists deprive women of (partly sexualised)
competence by attacking men who idealise highly competent women, as “sexist”.
On the other hand, some of them and many other women don’t have a problem
expressing their interest and attraction of men (celebrities/etc.) which
they perceive as sexy.

Cynicism is a mental disease that we should fight from within and without,
because it:

7.a.1 =] Prevents future growth.

7.a.2. =] Creates problems where none exist instead of solving problems
wherever they exist.

7.a.3. =] Has caused much more damage in the past than just that, up
to and including World War II, Genghis Khan’s conquests and destruction, a
lot of financial and economical red tape, and countless of other past and to a
lesser extent - present damage.

( I’m not implying cynical feminists are as bad as Hitler, just that it is
derived from the same core - cynicism. )

7.b) As opposed to popular belief, a woman (or a man) need not fit the
current stereotype of an object of attraction to be competent attractive. Two
big, somewhat fat, and mostly physically unattractive women, told me that
various men keep wanting them for themselves, and that similar things happen
to many other women they know, because they are competent women, who are
independent and strong and radiate confidence and sexiness.

A great deal of the most respected and most coveted Hollywood actors and
actresses and even models have not been overly physically attractive and
some of them were even underage, e.g:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple ;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay_Culkin ;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miley_Cyrus .
Samantha Smith ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith ) helped change
the fate of the cold war forever while being a 10 years old girl.

Feel free to forward my message to the list. I’d like to put what i wrote on
my Google+ and Facebook feeds, because I feel it is of more general interest.

I only skimmed the original message and plan on fully reading it, but will
appreciate a more point-by-point summary, more similar to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiHow or how I wrote the message. See below for
a note.

========================

Note about your style:
----------------------

I feel that the way I write my screenplays nowadays (see
http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/ ) is superior to the way
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand wrote The Fountainhead and Atlas
Shrugged back then, which I found incredibly lucid, coherent, and captivating,
but which she was in turn jealous of authors of boring Russian tomes such as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina , which are tedious and which I
avoid like the plague . [AynRand]

Television shows like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street (and
later developments including the Internet, Web 1.0, blogs, YouTube,
Facebook/Twitter/Google+, etc. etc.) changed the way most people expect to
consume
written text, and not for the worse, because some books of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh (a.k.a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament ) got to the point much quicker
than most of the original texts of the plays of Shakespeare , which
are often tedious
and unusable and many students of English nowadays have to positively suffer
through them.

Like Paul Graham notes in a different context, succinctness is power:

http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html

Regards Ayn Rand is a controversial character, and even I find
many of her words and deeds incredibly off in today’s standards. For the
record I have some parodies and/or modernisations of her stories:

* http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOWTF/ (The Fountainhead)

* http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ (Atlas Shrugged)

And finally, see:

http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#if_ayn_rand_was_born_in_the_1990s

Sorry if I went off-tangent.
