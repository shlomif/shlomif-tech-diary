Avoiding an horizontal scrollbar on mobile

Google Webmaster Tools reports that this page - https://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/meta/FAQ/about.xhtml - has a horizontal scrollbar in mobile mode. I verified its presence using Firefox's `Ctrl-shift-m` in 360x740 portrait mode. How can I eliminate the horizontal scrollbar there?

Note that adding `main { overflow: scroll; }` is a symptomatic (and not too good) fix, and I'm seeking a better solution.

( The XHTML and CSS both validate. )
