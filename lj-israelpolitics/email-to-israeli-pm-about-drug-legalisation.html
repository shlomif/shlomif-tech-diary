I
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/60773.html">announced that
    I sent an E-mail on 18 October, 2009 to the Israeli Prime Minister and the
    Minister of Internal Defence about drug legalisation</a> on my blog.
Here are its contents:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
(This letter is intended to the Prime Minister, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu and to
the Minister of Internal Security, Mr. Yitzhak Aharonovich).
</p>

<p>
Dear Sirs,
</p>

<p>
I sent this letter to you on the 4th of December [should be September], and
I did not get a reply - not even an automated one. Since it was close to the
Jewish holidays season, then I shall give you the benefit of the doubt, and
hope you will reply to me this time. I whould be thankful if you can
acknowledge that you have received this message.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, one should note that it is an open letter that is going to be
publicised
on <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/">my weblog</a>.
</p>
My name is Shlomi Fish, and I am a software developer, open source and
content activist, and writer of articles, essays and humorous stories. For a
long time, I am sure that Israel (like the other countries of the world) is
making a mistake in the fact that it enforces a prohibition on illegal
narcotics (such as Marijuana, Hash, Cocaine, and Heroin). While I never
touched these drugs, and I do not encourage their consumption, I believe that
the prohibition on drugs is much worse than the "Drug Abuse Problem" itself,
and even amplifies it.
<p>

<p>
In order to convince you, I am attaching an essay I wrote called "The Case
for Drug Legalisation", in HTML and PDF formats. (In order to prevent the
waste of paper, please don't print it.) One can find this essay in English
and in Hebrew on my Internet home-site in the address:

</p>

<p>
I will be happy to hear any comments you have on the essay. Please return
to me with your opinion on my suggestion to make drugs in Israel, legal.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
</p>

<p>
As a result, I have to conclude that the respected gentlemen have failed to
respond to me (a citizen and resident of Israel) on such an important issue and
are not fulfilling their duties as government officials.
</p>

<p>
Don't re-elect them - they don't care about you.
