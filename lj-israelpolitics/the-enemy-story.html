Back in 1997, I have written a story about Middle East politics
titled "The Enemy and How I Helped to Fight it", which I have placed
on my personal web-site,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">in
    its own section</a>. It is a humorous story and was originally
written in Hebrew, but I've translated it to English.

Here is the beginning of the English translation as a teaser:
</p>

<blockquote>

    <p><b>1. Left Without a Trace</b></p>

    <p>
I woke up in the morning and went to the post. It was a bright day at
the beginning of spring. When I walked down the road that leads to the
post, I enjoyed the lively green of the field, before the summer shows
its marks. Flowers bloomed there in the colors of white, yellow and
violet and I could hear the squeak of the birds that resided on the
trees and woke up before morning. Drops of dew shined on the shrubs
and flowers, and the ground was still moist from the rain that had
fallen there a day before. The sun just began to shine and in the sky
there was a war between the light-blue shade brought by the sun and
the dark red of the night.
</p>

<p>
In my opinion, it was a perfect day to launch missiles at the Enemy’s
soldiers. However, that was not what I intended to do that day.

<p>
As I came near the post I saw from afar that two of my
comrades were oiling one of the mortars that were in the
possession of my post. They were so busy that they did not notice
me until they heard me say "Good Morning." to them.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, the Member of the Organisation." They replied while
turning to see me. "How’s it going?" added one of them.
</p>

<p>
"Top of the world. I’m going to quit today."
</p>

<p>
"Really? That’s a shame! ‘We’ll miss you, bro’, like they say."
</p>

<p>
"Likewise. But we have to move on."
</p>

<p>
And so I walked away from them, opened the door that lead to the
office of the post’s commander and went in. The commander sat by the
table and read a pamphlet of pages that he held in his hand. It was
probably one of the many reports and files of instructions and
clarifications that he received. After I entered, he placed the
pamphlet on the table, turned to look at me and said: "Good morning,
the Member! Look, I read a couple of papers now and they explain that
we should initiate a transfer of…"
</p>

<p>
"Good morning to you too, Sir." I interrupted him. "Excuse me for
bothering you, but I don’t think it’s relevant anymore."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I came here to file my resignation."
</p>

<p>
"No way! Just ten minutes ago the other Member of the Organisation
resigned."
</p>

<p>
"Really?" I asked him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes. He is now bids the other members farewell."
</p>

<p>
"Why did he quit?"
</p>

<p>
"This and that. Said something that he couldn’t take all this stress
any longer, and that he wishes to find a stable job and raise a
family. He also noted that ‘it was fun to serve in the Organisation,
but it’s time to move on.’  "
</p>

<p>
"Okay."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but as they say: when it rains it pours. Well, just sign here
and I’ll take care of all the other paperwork."
</p>

<p>
After I started filling it, I said to him: “about the salary you gave
me...”
</p>

<p>
“Forget it!” the commander said and continued “during your service in
the Organisation, you've done a great service to your people and your
country. You've earned your pay, even if not honestly, and we thank
you that you've joined our ranks at all in the first place. I just
hope that during your civil life, you'll continue to maintain the
spirit of the organisation and its philosophy.”
</p>

<p>
“I'll do my best, sir.” I told him with a snap while I signed it. Then
I rose up and we shook hands. I thought a little about what the
commander just said, and then recalled something and sat down. "Look,
it may no longer be so relevant" I said to him "but I’ve been a member
of the Organisation for two years and nobody ever told me what the
philosophy of the Organisation was. What is it, really?"
