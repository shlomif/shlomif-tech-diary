<h2>2006-10-16: Nouveau</h2>

<p>
Having seen <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki">Nouveau</a>,
the open source 3-D drivers for Nvidia cards, mentioned in
<a href="http://lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</a> and recalling
that I wanted to help work on them myself, I decided to use some of my
free time to give it a try.
</p>

<p>
So I followed <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/InstallNouveau">the
instructions</a>, and then got a compilation error. The driver
could not find the <tt>linux/config.h</tt> header. Per the advice of someone
on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/nouveau">Freenode's #nouveau</a>, I
changed it to <tt>linux/autoconf.h</tt>, and that made it compile. (I'm using
the latest -rc kernel). I later encountered some problems with getting the
driver insmod'ed but these were also resolvable.
</p>

<p>
Then I restarted X to run it with it. It worked. I encountered a problem with
the fact that in KDE and multitple workspaces and .jpg files as background
that cover the whole screen, then I get tiling behaviour in the background
when switching workspaces that doesn't exist with "nv". What I mean is that
the redrawing of the new background is visible (left-to-right,
top-to-bottom). The people on #nouveau said that it is planned that this will
be resolved independently of Nouveau.
</p>

<p>
I'm planning to continue using this driver, and also potentially help by
writing code for it. La revolution lives on! (or in our case la nouveau-lution
lives on!)
</p>

<p>
By the way, this was the first time I used
<a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>, because that's the version control system
that Nouveau is using. It was not a very painful experience and I survived to
tell the tale. ;-)

<h2>2006-10-17: Eclipse on Mandriva 2007</h2>

<p>
So I was editing XML using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and again
decided that there may be a better editor out there. A google search for
"XML editor" or "open source XML editor" yielded nothing. Then I thought
that maybe <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> has a good XML
editing mode. So off to install Eclipse
</p>

<p>
I'm running Mandriva 2007 and the urpmi (Mandriva's package manager)
command for installing Eclipse ("urpmi eclipse") completed successfully,
after installing a lot of dependencies. Then I tried to run it from the
command line. It took it a long time, and then it crashed. After consulting
with the people on Freenode's #java, I was told that I should run it using
<a href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun's Java Development Kit</a> instead of with
gcj.
</p>

<p>
So I downloaded it, and the people there told me how to run Eclipse using it.
Just use the following commands:
</p>

<pre>
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_09
PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
</pre>

<p>
Then I was able to run Eclipse. However, when I tried to edit an XML file,
I got it without syntax highlighting, and without anything else. Turns out the
default XML editing mode of Eclipse is pretty lame. And a Google search for
"Eclipse XML" yielded only non-open-source solutions. So I still don't have
a better XML editor than gvim.
</p>

<p>
Again on #java, someone recommended
<a href="http://vex.sourceforge.net/">Vex</a>, which is a visual editor for
XML. But it provides a word-processor-like interface, that I won't like as I
want to edit the tags and need to edit "data-style" XML documents.
</p>

<p>
If anyone can suggest a good open-source XML editor that runs on Linux, please
comment here. In the meantime, gvim is all I have.

<h2>2006-10-17: www.shlomifish.org now Fully Validates</h2>

<p>
It took me a lot of hours of work, but I got all the files
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">on my homesite</a> (including those that
were not directly accessible), to validate as valid HTML or XHTML. This is
in continuation <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/14013.html">to this
entry</a>.  Using a customised version of
<a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/">the WDG validator</a> that
I installed on the localhost, I was able to find all the errors and warnings,
as well as fix many broken links, etc. It took a lot of work of tweaking HTML,
fixing broken links, adding DOCTYPE's and sometimes fixing the tools that
generated bad HTML.
</p>

<p>
Like I said, it took a lot of work, but now I feel both accomplished and
relieved. The validator reports a few errors for the DocBook/XML files because
it cannot find their DTD, but that's it. Now I'd better start doing something
more important... ;-).

<h2>2006-11-03: Building GHC 6.6 on Mandriva</h2>

<p>
I decided to try to build the latest
<a href="http://www.pugscode.org/">Pugs</a> (from the subversion trunk). The
INSTALL file said: "Pugs needs the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), preferably
version 6.6 or above.". OK, but Mandriva only has GHC 6.4. So I decided to
make the world a bit better by preparing ghc-6.6 packages for Mandriva.
</p>

<p>
At first I installed the Mandriva ghc-6.4 source rpm, and then looked at the
ghc 6.6 RPM Spec from <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">the ghc
homepage</a> and adapted the Mandriva RPM accordingly. Then I started the
building. It took a long time so I let it run overnight. In the morning when I
woke up, I realised the RPM building was not successful. Apparently, the
Mandriva RPM Spec building process also built the documentation and the makefile
called <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haddock/">haddock</a> with an unknown
flag. I realised I had to install the latest haddock version (0.8).
</p>

<p>
So I had to prepare an up-to-date haddock package. I started but then
the build failed towards the end because the <tt>/usr/bin/haddock-0.8</tt>
binary was not installed. I guessed it was removed, and removed it from the
RPM spec and built again. This time it was OK and I was able to install the
binary RPM.
</p>

<p>
After haddock-0.8 was installed, I was able to install and build ghc-6.6.
(After a few hours of compilation time). However, afterwards when I tried to
compile pugs, but it compiled that it could not find the "mtl" library. I
consulted people on the IRC about it and someone told me I should also build
the src-extralibs package of ghc by unpacking it in the same directory.
</p>

<p>
I modified the RPM SPEC of ghc-6.6 to do exactly that, and rebuilt. I installed
ghc-6.6 again, and again tried to compile pugs. It still complained about the
"mtl library". Searcing for "mtl" in the ghc RPM build tree yielded the fact
it was installed under the "ghc-6.6/ghc-6.6/" sub-directory there. As it turned
out I used the rpm %setup macro in the wrong way: I used the <tt>-a 1</tt>
(which unpacks the source in 1 after cd'ing into the directory) instead of
<tt>-b 1</tt>, which unpacks the source before cd'ing there.
</p>

<p>
Thus, I had to rebuild ghc after this correction. After a few more hours
of compilation, the rpm was prepared, and I was able to install it. This time,
I was able to compile pugs, and I even tested it and submitted a smoke test.
<a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=26844">This report to the
Mandriva bug tracker</a> is the result of my efforts and contains links to the
RPMs I prepared.
</p>

<p>
I spent at least a day working on it, but a hacker got to do what a hacker got
to do.

<h2>2006-11-11: Lately I've been...</h2>

<p>
Lately I've been playing a lot of computer games. Mostly PySol,
<a href="http://fillets.sourceforge.net/">Fish Fillets</a>, WarCraft 3,
or Monkey Island 4 (last both on the nearby Windows machine). I've made quite
a lot of progress in them. While I don't play too much, it seems that I've
been much less productive than at the times I didn't play at all. I mostly
didn't code.
</p>

<p>
I've also been resting at bed during the mornings, and yesterday also rested
for an hour or so after lunch. Today, however, I woke up early, ate breakfast
at 11:00 and did not sleep, so maybe I'm back on track. I also spent the
day until now doing some mostly productive work (like fixing WWW-Search-MSN
bugs, or writing
<a href="http://perl.org.il/pipermail/perl/2006-November/008306.html">a
report on the last meeting of the Israeli Perl mongers</a>.)
</p>

<p>
I've been making some progress on
<a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a>, and also
a lot of other reading. Sometimes I feel that I'm reading too much. And I'm
having a love-hate relationship with my RSS aggregator.

<h2>2006-11-16: Inbox Cleanup</h2>

<p>
I'm down to 3 messages in my email inbox. All the other ones that got gathered
there have been sorted out, deleted or archived. I don't remember having so few
messages there since I started using kmail (and my inbox was empty).
</p>

<p>
Of course, I have more messages in my Gmail inbox and my inbox in a
Technion host, but I can still give myself a positive feedback. Yay!

<h2>2006-11-17: Editors and IDEs Resources</h2>

<p>
Recently there were two discussions on editors/IDEs for Perl on two mailing
lists I'm subscribed to:
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl-xml/3336894">one
on the Perl XML mailing list</a> and
<a href="http://lists.rawmode.org/pipermail/catalyst/2006-November/010390.html">one
on the Catalyst mailing list</a>.
</p>

<p>
They are interesting and informative and not too flamatory. In
<a href="http://lists.rawmode.org/pipermail/catalyst/2006-November/010418.html">one
post</a> someone posted a link to
<a href="http://texteditors.org/">texteditors.org, which is a wiki
dedicated to text editors</a>, which seems nice as well. I already added
several Emacs jokes.

<h2>2006-11-17: htdig on Mandriva</h2>

<p>
After I woke up today, I decided to make myself a daily schedule. So I
copied my last daily schedule (back from 8-August) and updated. One of the
items there read - "<a href="http://www.htdig.org/">htdig</a>
Mandriva bug." (that my friend reported and
I confirmed). Since it was very old, I decided to finally get to
investigate it.
</p>

<p>
Searching for "htdig" on the Mandriva bug tracker yielded
<a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=19275">this bug report, which
was still open</a>, and I could confirm the bug still existed by installing
htdig and running it. After I downloaded the source RPM and looked at it and the
htdig site, I saw that the version in the source RPM was out of date
(3.2.0b2-something while 3.2.0b5 has already been released). So I updated it,
and tried to recompile. It took several "rpm -bb" iterations to get the RPMs
to build: I had to remove out of date patches, add one of my own to fix a
compilation bug, and mess up with the installed files list. Eventualy it
got built and I installed the modified package, and tried to run it again.
This time the bug was not reproduced.
</p>

<p>
I uploaded the updated package only in the evening and posted a link in the
bug report. Between that,
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/31646">I got my aggregated
RSS feed to work again</a>. Now I've built the
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/209765/">new kernel</a> and am preparing to
install it. There goes my 8 days uptime...
</p>

<p>
<b>P.S.:</b> if you want to get an audio feedback once a long compilation
ends, you can do something like:
<tt>make bzImage modules ; mplayer -ao arts /home/shlomi/Music/mp3s/"Jenna Drey - Why Should I Believe You (Rock Version ).mp3"</tt> .
Substitute "make bzImage modules" with the compilation command, "-ao arts"
with your favourite  "mplayer" params", and the Jenna Drey song with a media
file you'd like to hear.

<h2>2006-11-18: Daily Log</h2>

<p>
Today was a productive day, as it was not interrupted by bugs or other
disrepencies. It started with writing and posting
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/31651">a blog entry
about Test::Run</a>. Then I added pages for
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/puzzles/cs/lotg/">the "Lotg" code</a>
and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/puzzles/situation/book-under-rock.html">my
own situation puzzle</a> to my home site.
</p>

<p>
I was able to bike during the afternoon (starting around 15:00). Afterwards,
I worked on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Form/">WWW::Form</a>:
fixing a bug that was caused due to a Test::More regression (hopefully more
about it later), raising its
<a href="http://cpants.perl.org/kwalitee.html">kwalitee</a> and releasing a new
version on CPAN.
</p>

<p>
Finally, during the evening when I was tired, I caught up with my Slashdot
interview backlog.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow there's a Telux "Welcome-to-Linux" meeting and there's going to be a
Pythoneers meeting on wednesday. I also have to find out the whereabouts of
the next Perl-IL meeting so I can publicise it.

<h2>2006-11-21: Spaceballs</h2>

<p>
I just returned from a walk where it occured to me that
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094012/">Spaceballs</a> is a pun
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball">Baseball</a>. And it came
to me when thinking of one of the latest
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball">Foxtrot</a> cartoons, which
I read earlier today.
</p>

<p>
It often takes me a lot of time to detect some puns, but this one took about
15 years for me to get to the bottom of, which is very exceptional, even for
me.

<h2>2006-11-22: Adventures of a Finite Simple Group of Order Two</h2>

<p>
Today I checked my gmail E-mail and saw that my friend sent me a link
to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTby_e4-Rhg">a hilarious
videoclip of "A Finite Simple Group (of Order Two)</a> by
<a href="http://www.kleinfour.com/">the Klein Four Group</a>, which are a
mathematically-inclined a-capella group. I liked it so much that I decided to
send it to the members of my long-forgotten Jokes Distribution List using my
KDE mail account.
</p>

<p>
Well, the problem was that it really was long-forgotten as KAddressbook did
not list it or any other distribution list I had prepared in its previous
incarnations. So I decided to investigate. I created a new distribution list
with a few members and saved it. When inspecting the KAddressbook directory
(<tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kabc/</tt>) I found it no longer stored them in
the file <tt>distlists</tt> but rather inside <tt>std.vcf</tt> in
specially-formatted records. So I whipped up
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits.html#kaddressbook_dist_lists">a
quick Perl script</a> to convert it to the new format, which worked after a
tweak or two. After restarting kmail, I was able to see my distribution lists'
again, and could send my mail.
</p>

<p>
Since the video had no sub-titles and one of the people on the list is deaf,
I googled for the lyrics for this song and found
<a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~matt/kleinfour/lyrics/finite.html">them</a>, and included a link to them in my email.
</p>

<p>
So far so good. But then I decided I like the song so much that I wanted to
listen to it using Amarok (my music player) from time to time. So I moved
the .flv (Flash Video) file I had downloaded from the Youtube link using
<a href="http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a>, to my
mp3's directory and tried to enqueue it using Amarok. It didn't work, as
Amarok complained it lacked an audio channel. Trying to play it in xine,
which is the Amarok media-playing backend I'm using didn't work as well. It
seemed like a xine limitation.
</p>

<p>
Then I remembered
<a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/08/22/2121258">this article
about converting from .flv to DivX or Xvid</a> that I saw on Linux.com. I
followed its instructions and ran the script. It did a whole lot of stuff,
but I couldn't find the file. As it turned out, my filename contained
whitespace characters, which broke the script and caused it to output to
the file <tt>.avi</tt> (which is normally invisible). To fix it I had to
change:
</p>

<pre>
 "`basename $1 .flv`.avi"
</pre>

with:

<pre>
 "`basename "$1" .flv`.avi"
</pre>

<p>
Which made it work. Now Amarok could play the AVI file, but not rewind and
fast-forward it. Possibly another limitation.
</p>

<p>
All this time I was talking on IRC. I joined #kde in order to resolve my
distribution list problem, and there I helped a few people. While I was
in the neighbourhood, I decided to join #math and let them know of the
song. Someone there recognised it, and gave me
<a href="http://www.kleinfour.com/">the link to the Klein Four Group's</a>.
There I found audios in mp3's formats and videos in Windows Media's .wmv
format for many of their songs (including "Finite Simple Group (of Order
Two)"). So in this case, I didn't have had to bother with flv2avi.sh. (Albeit
it may come in handy some other time).
</p>

<p>
So now the Jews have Joy and Aura, and I can listen to the song comfortably.
I listened to it at least 5 times today. I'd also like to check their other
recordings.
</p>

<p>
<b>P.S:</b> when I said that "C++ is complex, complexified and complexifying",
I thought the
<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=complexify">verb
"complexify"</a> did not really exist, but <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=complexify">it does</a>, and it appears
in this song.

<h2>2006-11-22: Personal Log</h2>

<p>
Yesterday's afernoon I got a throat ache, which worsened towards the night.
Then as I was trying to sleep, I got shivers. I guess I became sick. Today
I'm feeling better, with a post-shiver feeling.
</p>

<p>
Due to this flu, I missed a job interview today (that was supposed to take
place at a nearby café) and <a href="http://wiki.python.org.il/Meeting_22_November_2006">a meeting of the Israeli Pythoneers</a> which seemed very interesting.
This was the first meeting in a long time, and I missed many meetings before
that, due to my work schedule. So I was really looking forward to it.
</p>

<p>
So instead I'm working on the computer, taking walks in the neighbourhood,
eating, and drinking water. I woke up today at 6 AM (while falling asleep at
around 2 AM), but still cannot really get myself to rest. So, it's a more or
less typical day except for feeling a bit worse physically.
</p>

<p>
On a different note, I've been chatting on the IRC with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Coar">Ken Coar</a>, and trying to
help him with some Perl and perl-related problems. It's quite a honour.

<h2>2006-11-24: Word of the Day: Lough</h2>

<p>
I've been chatting on Instant Messaging today, and accidently typed "lough"
instead of "laugh". I noticed the spell checker did not highlight it when
I corrected my mistake and decided to check what it means. Here's
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:lough&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=glossary_definition&amp;ct=title">the definition of "lough"</a> -
it's Irish for "lake".
</p>

<p>
It reminded me of "loch" (which is the Scottish Gaelic equivalent)
and the English word "lake" so I checked their etymologies on m-w.com. Turns
out they all stem from the same root, which is common in many
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages">Indo-European
languages</a>.
</p>

<p>
I normally don't recall new words that I encounter, but I think I'll remember
this one. Of course, it seems too obscure to be useful.
</p>

</div>

<div class="entry">

<h2>2006-11-25: My First Amarok Scripting Experience</h2>

<p>
Currently I'm still using
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/9563.html">Amarok</a> as a music
player, and I like very much. One thing that kept bothering me, even back
when I was using <a href="http://www.xmms.org/">XMMS</a>, was that sometimes
I had to fiddle with the volume because the songs were too loud or too soft.
I tried using <a href="http://volnorm.sourceforge.net/">XMMS Volnorm</a>
but it caused the songs to have artificats and since it operated only on
portions of the songs, damaged volume increasing and decreasing effects.
</p>

<p>
But I had a better idea. Why not keep track of the volume the user used for
each song, and restore it to its last value when the song is played again?
Today, I finally decided to implement exactly that on my Amarok system somehow.
When I searched for something to do that on Google, I could not find anything
for Amarok, but found a different Java player that sported "per-song volume".
So per-song volume it would be.
</p>

<p>
After reading the
<a href="http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/Script-Writing_HowTo">Amarok Script-Writing
Howto</a>,
I knew how to write this script. It's very simple really: one used the
<tt>dcop</tt> command line command to control Amarok, and listens to events
that are sent as lines on the standard input. I initially thought I'll need
to use Ruby for that, but the Ruby examples on the page did not use any
external KDE or Amarok-specific bindings, so Perl is also suitable, and I used
it instead due to the laziness factor.
</p>

<p>
The script I wrote keeps a state of the current volume and the current song,
and maintains the recorded volumes inside an SQLite database (which is just a
single file on the filesystem.). Writing it was not very hard, but I encountered
a few bugs I had to tackle.
</p>

<p>
What turned out to be more irritating was uploading the script to
<a href="http://kde-apps.org/">kde-apps.org</a>. I had an account there
(possibly due to my old kde-look.org account), and so logged in, but after
changing the password got rejected. An email with the password that I sent
to myself indicate the password I had was correct. I opened another account
with the same password and again no luck.
</p>

<p>
After inspecting the markup and seeing that the password
<tt>&lt;input /&gt;</tt> tag contained a truncated version of the password,
I conjectured that maybe it couldn't handled long passwords properly. That was
indeed the case, and I could login from a new account I opened and upload the
script. I recall that I struggled with it so much that I didn't eat by 8:20
PM.
</p>

<p>
After <a href="http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=49151">the
script was uploaded</a> I
<a href="http://amarok.kde.org/amarokwiki/index.php?title=Scripts&amp;diff=10932&amp;oldid=10923">updated
the Amarok wiki</a>. I noticed at the top that
there were also French and German versions of that page. Therefore, I joined
#perlcafe, and got someone
<a href="http://amarok.kde.org/amarokwiki/index.php?title=Fr%3AScripts&amp;diff=10934&amp;oldid=10922">to
update the French page</a> with that information as well (just for the heck of
it). Looking at a note inside the WikiWiki markup at the top it seems that I
also need to add it to the German page (so it'll be in the sync with the
English one).
</p>

<p>
Today I also added <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits.html#amarok">a
section to my Open-Source "Bits and Bobs" page with this script</a>.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, this script received an average rating of "50% Good" in the
kde-apps.org page, and no comments were posted on the page. I've started using
it and it seems to work very nicely for me so far. Maybe you'll find it useful
too, or would like to implement similar functionality for other music players.
Oh and I'd also like to implement a compatible script in Common Lisp because
I'm learning it now. Stay tuned.

<h2>2006-11-29: Vim Tips</h2>

<p>
I apologise for not posting here in a few days, but publicising the
<a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/telux/">Tel Aviv Linux club</a> meetings,
and <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/31718">working
on this year's Perl Advent Calendar</a> is relatively time-consuming. But now
happy that I finished two articles for the calendar, I can blog a little
about other stuff, like Vim Tips.
</p>

<p>
So here are two Vim tips I've found:
</p>

<ol>

<h2>2006-12-07: The LoggedFS Chronicles</h2>

<p>
(This entry was adapted from an IRC monologue I made on the fly yesterday.)
</p>

<p>
I have <a href="http://lists.gllug.org.uk/pipermail/gllug/2006-December/064342.html">a problem</a>
with KDE that some of the colours get reverted to bad settings. And as I found
out (by reading the KDE source)
<a href="http://lists.gllug.org.uk/pipermail/gllug/2006-December/064353.html">it
is stored in kdeglobals</a>, which keeps getting over-rided to one without the
appropriate keys.
</p>

<p>
So I was looking for a way to find out which process overwrites kdeglobals.
Now I knew about <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">FUSE</a> which allows
one to write File Systems in user-land. And on the <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems">FUSE filesystemspage</a> I found
<a href="http://loggedfs.sourceforge.net/">loggedFS</a>, which is a
logging file system that takes a directory, over-rides it and logs all
actions (using the over-rided filesystem as the backend). I decided to give
it a try.
</p>

<p>
Well, it took me some time to get it up and running with my
<tt>~/.kde/share/config directory</tt>. It required some change to the build
system because there was a new FUSE API version. And I needed to add a flag
(after trying to find how). I also had to compile and install the fuse kernel
module for my kernel. After all that it was up and running.
</p>

<p>
So I tried to use it with KDE. KDE loaded but konqueror did not run.
After some stracing I found the problem was with the KLockFile class and
a lock file that was created in the config/ directory.
</p>

<p>
So after some time of inspecting the code without knowing why exactly it
failed, I decided to add some fprintf's there to see what's wrong. I had to
compile the apporpriate "kdecore" library, with the changes I added and then
use LD_LIBRARY_PATH with konqueror to load the custom library.
</p>

<p>
And as it turned out the temporary lock file and its permanent hard link did
not have the same inode. This seemed like a problem with the loggedFS mounted
filesystem as <tt>ls -i</tt> returned very low numbers and not the real
inodes. So I wanted to see what's wrong.
</p>

<p>
I added debugs to the loggedFS driver. And debugged the kernel using
<a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User-mode Linux</a>. As it
turned out the kernel received 0xFFFFFFFF as the inode number. This took me a
lot of time to find out. So I decided to compile libfuse with debugging
information and find out. After stepping into the fuse functions, I found out
that there was a line there that set the inodes to this 0xFFFFFFFF value,
because it didn't receive the <tt>use_ino</tt> option. After I added the
use_ino option to loggedFS, konqueror worked with the <tt>config</tt>
directory mounted using it.
</p>

<p>
I then felt like I wanted to faint.
</p>

<p>
After running loggedfs, I realised kdeglobals was changed, but the change was
not logged. As it turned out it was not done by a write call, but by moving
a temporary <tt>kdeglobals</tt> on top of the permanent one (Using a
rename system call). And is it turned out, this was done many times, and only
at certain times resulted in the faulty contents. Therefore, I decided to
create my own modification of loggedFS, to check for such renames. After doing
that, I received the appropriate notice today, and as it turns out it is
a <tt>kio_smtp</tt> kdeinit process. Which means, I'll have to look at its
source code.
</p>

<p>
All of this took more than an entire day of work, while I neglected other
priorities. I ended up with 177 unread items in my feeds' aggregator (which
I've gone over since), and also neglected my email and had no IM presence. But
at least I was successful in getting the problem traced.

<h2>2006-12-08: LoggedFS and KDE Problem Update</h2>

<p>
As an update to <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/22219.html">my
previous entry</a>, I'd like to note that the changes I made to LoggedFS
are now available as
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/code/loggedfs-3.patch">this
patch</a>. I sent it to the author for incorporation into the main code,
but until then it can be downloaded from my site.
</p>

<p>
The KDE Problem I discovered is now tracked in this
<a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=27528">Mandriva Bug</a>,
and if anyone who reads this blog can try to reproduce it with his version
of KDE and kmail, I'd be happy to
<a href="mailto:shlomif@iglu.org.il">hear such reports</a>.
</p>

</div>

<div class="entry">

<h2>2006-12-12: Tip: Mandriva's msec resetting permissions of directories and how to prevent that</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva Linux'</a> msec cron job has a tendency to reset the permissions of several files and directories on a Mandriva system. If you want to keep a certain permission, then what you need to do is invoke <tt>drakperm</tt> as root, and add a rule there to set the permission to a certain (usually more permissive) value.
</p>

<p>
I ran into such a problem when Mandriva kept removing the group and public
read flags from the "shlomi" user home directory (and from other users under
<tt>/home</tt>). After I ran drakperm and added a rule for <tt>/home/shlomi</tt>
it no longer happened. I got the "drakperm" tip today from people on the
IRC (Freenode's #mandriva channel), so thanks to them as well.
</p>

<div class="entry">

<h2>2006-12-12: New Screen</h2>

<p>
Earlier <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/11452.html">when I reported
on my hardware wishlist</a>, I mentioned that I want a new screen and one
that's flat. My sister's workplace had a special offer of such a screen so we
decided to buy one. I got it today, and my father and I set it up at the
evening.
</p>

<p>
It's a ViewSonic VA903m screen, a flat one, and it's either 19" or 17", but
still bigger than my previous CRT one. Mandriva 2007 did not have an Xorg
pre-definition for it, so I used the VA800 one (which was the closest) and
it seems fine. I'm doing 1280*1024 on this screen, and can see two konsoles
(KDE's terminal emulator) one below the other. It comes with speakers, but
when my father and I tested them they sounded awful so we reverted to our
standalone speakers.
</p>

<p>
The picture is very sharp, but some of the colours are wrong. Using the
screen's controls, I set the brightness and contrast to their minimum, but
some colours still look weird. I still like it better than the previous
screen, due to the size and the resolution.
</p>

<h2>2006-12-12: Grey Cat, Puzzles and some Vim Tips</h2>

<p>
When I went out today on a walk, I saw a pure grey (not striped) street cat
walking on the sidewalk. I don't believe I've seen him before. He was very
majestic and reminded me of a majestic grey cat who used to hang around the
ground floor of my previous building. The fur of the cat I saw today was
somewhat darker, though.
</p>

<p>
That put aside, I dedicated some time to work on
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/puzzles/">my home site's puzzles
section</a>. I traced the solution of the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/puzzles/logic/ravensborgs-guild/">Ravensborg's
Guild puzzle</a>, and as I discovered it had some missing information required
to solve it. The corrected riddle along with the solution is on that page now.
I also traced the solution of
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/puzzles/logic/between-the-screws/">"Between
the Screws</a>. This time there wasn't any missing information but there were
a few hints that I did not need.
</p>

<p>
Next on my agenda in the puzzle arena is to trace the solution (and the
final outcome) for
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/puzzles/logic/tip-of-the-sword/">another
puzzle</a>, and to integrate the grammatical corrections an IRC correspondant
reported on "Between the Screws".
</p>

<p>
And now for some Vim tips. One can use the vim black hole register (or
null register) <tt>"_</tt> (<tt>:help "_</tt>) to delete text using the
"d" or "c" commands without
affecting the other registers. So one can press <tt>"_d{movement}p</tt> to
safely paste text. The second tip (which I discovered when looking for the
reference for this one) is that pressing <tt>"</tt> followed by the uppercase
letter of a register, will append text to this register.
</p>

<p>
I hope you enjoyed this entry. Until next time, stay cool!

<div class="entry">

<h2>2006-12-14: Vim Tip: Pasting with &quot;P&quot;</h2>

<p>
Today I suddenly wondered that if "p" (in lowercase) was paste in Vim, what
did "P" (in uppercase) do. I guessed that what it did was that it pasted
before the line of the cursor, rather than after it. (In a similar fashion to
the distinction between "o" and "O"). And that's
<a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#P">what
it indeed does</a> (<tt>:help P</tt>).
</p>

<p>
This is useful because it behaves more like the MS-Windows paste, and also
allows one to paste to the first line of the file. I'm now thinking it might
be a good idea to go over all the uppercase letter commands in Vim and see
what they do because I don't know them all.

<h2>2006-12-15: Mandriva Tip: Cancelling the Initial Konqueror Redirect</h2>

<p>
When you fire up a konqueror window on Mandriva Linux then what happens is that
it loads a page and then redirect you to a page on the Mandriva servers. This
redirect is annoying because it takes place even if you start to type an address
in the address bar. Here's how to cancel it.
</p>

<p>
Fire up a terminal and type the following command:
</p>

<p>
<tt>perl -pe '/^View0_URL/ &amp;&amp; s/(about:)mandrakelinux/${1}blank/'
&lt; /usr/share/apps/konqueror/profiles/webbrowsing
&gt; ~/.kde/share/apps/konqueror/profiles/webbrowsing</tt>
</p>

<p>
What this command does is create a custom user "webbrowsing" profile for
Konqueror where the default page is converted from "about:mandrakelinux" to
"about:blank". It affects only a single user. If you're interested in
making this change system wide then use the following untested command
as root:
</p>

<p>
<tt>perl -pi -e '/^View0_URL/ &amp;&amp; s/(about:)mandrakelinux/${1}blank/'
/usr/share/apps/konqueror/profiles/webbrowsing</tt>
</p>

<p>
Now my redirect is gone and I'm much less annoyed. Happy browsing!

<h2>2006-12-16: SQL Trouble - String Concatenation</h2>

<p>
For a web application I'm working on, I need to concatenate many fields
delimited by a delimiter into one large text field. So I lookuped up a way
to do concatenation in SQL, and
<a href="http://www.1keydata.com/sql/sql-concatenate.html">found out that there
is no standard way to concatenate in SQL</a>:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
In MySQL, one uses the a concat() function which accepts multiple arguments.
</li>
<li>
In Oracle, concat() accepts only two arguments, and there's also the "||"
infix operator which can be chained.
</li>
<li>
In MS SQL Server, one uses the "+" operator.
</li>
<li>
In <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users%40sqlite.org/msg11082.html">SQLite also has the "||" operator</a>.
</li>
<li>
PostgreSQL also has <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/6.4/static/operators1855.htm">the || operator</a>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In short, there's no portable way to do such an elementary operation. The
"||" operator seems to be the most widely supported but it is not supported
by MSSQL and MySQL. Thus, for the application I wrote I ended up doing the
concatenation in Perl.
</p>

<p>
('ANSI ' || 'SQL' || ' Standard')-- (Assuming it will work in your SQL
implementation).

<h2>2006-12-18: MSN Password Trouble</h2>

<p>
I decided to change my MSN password yesterday as my previous password was
relatively simple. So I changed it to a long password with some gibberish
words that were partly l33t-speaked. The change at the
<a href="https://accountservices.passport.net/">Microsoft Passport site</a>
worked fine in Mozilla (in Konqueror it had some display problems). Then I
tried to log in using the new password from Kopete.
</p>

<p>
It didn't work. I typed it again - still no. I decided that maybe
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/21283.html">the password
was too long</a>, and reduced it one character after the other manually. Still
no good. Eventually (quite late at night), I changed the password to a shorter
one that did not overflow the MSN password field. This time I was able to
login using Kopete.
</p>

<p>
This reminded me of <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/21283.html">this
incident</a> only this time, I was able to revert. My password is now 11
alpha-numeric characters, in case anyone is experiencing any similar problems.

<h2>2006-12-20: The End of an Era: Closing my Account at Bank Discount</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.discount-bank.co.il/">Bank Discount</a> was the first
bank I opened an account in, back when I was in high school. However, due
to the poor support its site had for Linux-based browsers at the time,
I opened an account in <a href="http://www.fibi.co.il/">the First
International Bank of Israel</a>, whose site admins were more conscious to
web standards. There I received my payments from my last workplace, and
also started having a credit card proper.
</p>

<p>
Now since I'm paying a commission fee for the account in Bank Discount, and
don't make much use of it, I decided to close it. So I went there a few
days ago, and closed my account, while taking all my money out and putting
it in the other bank account. So this is the end of an era where I had an
account in Bank Discount, which was my first bank, and the one with which
I dealt most of my banking life.
</p>

<p>
Recently it was published
<a href="http://linmagazine.co.il/node/view/31553">that Bank Discount blocks

1.5.0.x. Hmmm...

<h2>2006-12-21: Getting Nouveau to run with kernel 2.6.20-rc1</h2>

<p>
The Mesa DRM kernel drivers as available from the <a href="git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/drm/">Mesa DRM GIT repository</a>
have been broken with kernel 2.6.20-rc1 since its release. Yesterday, I spent
some time getting them to compile and was able to do so.
<a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9408">This issue</a>
tracks the patch which I wrote, which is apparently incorrect in some
respects. It took me quite some time to write it, because I'm not a kernel
expert, because some of the #ifdef magic was confusing, and because it took
me some time to find out how to make the kernel makefile print the gcc
invocation command (which for the record is "make V=1").
</p>

<p>
After that, what I did to get Nouveau (the Open-Source Nvidia drivers) up and
running is based but deviating from <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/InstallNouveau">these instructions</a>:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Built the intel_agp kernel module which was missing from my configuration. This
module, or a different AGP module depending on your system is required for
Nouveau to run in recent releases.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
One should use the default branch ("master") instead of the "nouveau-1"
branch as "nouveau-1" was already merged into it.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I built and installed the drm library and headers but under /usr/local
(<tt>./configure</tt> with no parameters), so it will not interfere with
the distribution copy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Afterwards when building "xf86-video-nouveau", I got some errors starting with
<tt>/usr/local/include/xf86drm.h:569: error: expected declaration specifiers
or `...' before `drm_drawable_info_type_t'</tt>. To fix it, I had to tweak
the include paths.
</p>
<p>
Change the includes on the line starting with <tt>AM_CFLAGS = </tt> from something like:
</p>
<p>
<tt>-I/usr/include/xorg -I/usr/include/drm -I/usr/include/X11/dri</tt>
</p>
<p>
to:
</p>
<p>
<tt>-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/drm -I/usr/include/xorg -I/usr/include/X11/dri</tt>
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Afterwards, I was able to get Nouveau up and running and am using it now.
Enjoy!

<h2>2006-12-22: Job-Related Reading</h2>

<p>
I don't know if I mentioned it, but I eventually decided against becoming
a freelancer, and spent some time looking for a suitable job. A week or two
ago, I was accepted into a job as a Linux kernel/rivers programmer, over in
Herzliya Pituakh, and decided to accept it. This is especially encouraging,
because it was one of the first few jobs I was interviewed in, and because
I was not looking too hard. I'm starting to work on January.
</p>

<p>
Since I don't have a lot of experience doing kernel development, I was given a
reading list. So now I'm in the middle of reading
<a href="http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/">Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Edition</a>

<h2>2006-12-28: Update</h2>

<p>
Three nights ago, my computer made strange noises. They had a certain
long repetition duration. I decided to turn off the computer for the night,
and see what happens in the morning. When I turned on the computer the next
morning it made loud noises. Since this had me worried I decided to do a
backup of all the files, in case something happens - which I did. I left it on
since, and the noises subsided, so I don't know what was wrong originally.
</p>

<p>
I've finished reading all the relevant chapters out of
<a href="http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/">Linux Device Drivers</a>. I kept some
notes with Errors I found, and reported the ones that have not been reported
yet to <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxdrive3/errata/">the book

<h2>2007-01-01: Gringotts-Shlomif Patch</h2>

<p>
Today was my first day at work. I needed to use the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits-and-bobs/gringotts-patch/">Gringotts
secure notes application</a>, for which I've been maintaining a patch, to read
some files. So I built it by downloading the gringotts-1.2.9pre1 archive from
the Debian servers, and applying my patch from my site. However, when I
invoked the preferences dialog, it crashed. So I decided to check it at home.
</p>

<p>
Back at home, I found that I couldn't reproduce the crash. However, a version
that I compiled using the archive and patch still crashed. What I found out
after a small amount of debugging was that I fixed this regression in my
local repository back in July, but did not release a new patch to fix it for
the rest of the world. (Including me at work). Quite the negligence on my part.
</p>

<p>
So today, I updated the changelog, tagged the trunk, created a new patch,
uploaded it to my site, and posted an annoucement on
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</a> (which isn't on the front
page yet). I'll try to be more responsible in this regard in the future.

As for my first day at work - today I set up my work computer. I installed
Mandriva on it using the Mandriva One 2007 CD, and coped with several problems

that I wanted to be working was (except perhaps for the gringotts "preferences"
dialog).

<h2>2007-01-01: Standard ML / O'Caml Tip : Two or More Functions that Call Each Other</h2>

<p>
In case you wish to to create two functions that call each other (or
Mutually recursive functions as the proper terminology is) in Standard
ML (SML), or O'Caml you can use the <tt>and</tt> keyword. In SML:
</p>

<pre>
fun func1 (n:int) :int = if n=0 then 1 else func2 (n-1) * 2
and func2 (n:int): int = if n=0 then 0 else func1 (n-1) +1;
</pre>

<p>
Or in O'Caml:
</p>

<pre>
let rec func1 (n:int) :int = if n=0 then 1 else func2 (n-1) * 2
and func2 (n:int): int = if n=0 then 0 else func1 (n-1) +1;;

Printf.printf "func2(5) = %d\n" (func2 5);;

For more information refer <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/caml-list/1650.html">to
this O'Caml related resource</a> and to
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs312/2006sp/lectures/lec03.html">this
Standard ML related resource</a>. I had problems finding this because I
searched for "call each other" instead of "mutually recursive".
</p>

<p>
BTW, I was surprised to learn that Caml/O'Caml and SML are very incompatible.
I thought that generally O'Caml was a superset of SML, but as it turns out
O'Caml cannot compile a lot of SML code. Apparently they both diverged from
an early "ML" proto-language and went on their own ways.

<h2>2007-01-01: Not &quot;Curly&quot; - Pearly!</h2>

<p>
On Saturday when I was visiting someone to fix his Linux installation, I
heard on a radio a familiar song which I was looking for. I kept thinking
it was "The Days of Curly Spencer", but after googling a bit for keywords
out of it I found out it was <a href="http://www.zenuk.com/links/page/davidmcwilliams.html">"The Days of <b>Pearly</b> Spencer</a>. "Pearly" - not "Curly".
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough I was able to find <a href="http://www.goodwords.co.uk/THE%20DAYS%20OF%20CURLY%20SPENCER.htm">a story called "The Days of Curly Spencer"</a>
back in my original searches. Hmmppff...

<h2>2007-01-03: Problem with an AC'97 Soundcard and Windows XP</h2>

<p>
At work I received a recycled computer for my workstation. I installed Mandriva
Linux 2007 (using the Mandriva One installation CD) on it and it detected all
the hardware without a hitch. Windows XP (which I need to run a Windows-only
VMWare admin client) was a completely different story. It reported three things
that it could not detect: the Ethernet card, the soundcard, and the video
adaptor.
</p>

<p>
We were able to install the drivers for the Ethernet card by connecting
a co-worker's USB disk, and then we had networking, after consulting the Linux
installation for its type. Linux said the soundcard is an AC'97 one, but installing
<a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=14&amp;PFid=23&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false">these
drivers from the Realtek site</a> (first hit on Google for "AC97"), caused the
computer to abruptly reboot in the middle of the installation. The second time
it happened, I filed a report to the Microsoft site, but they gave me the same
link with the drivers.
</p>

<p>
And <a href="http://www.softwaretipsandtricks.com/forum/drivers/26195-ac97-driver-xp-needed.html">I'm
not the only one who have encountered this problem.</a>. I wonder what I
should do. I'll go mad if I can't listen to music while working on the
computer, especially when working on a crappy OS like Windows.

<h2>2007-01-03: Review of bloglines (Web-based Feed Aggregators - Part 1)</h2>

<p>
Lately I've been looking for a web-based RSS/Atom reader. This is because I've
started working and want to catch up on my feeds from work as well as from
home. The first such service I tried (yesterday) is
<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>. Registration was
straightforward and worked. However, I then noticed several problems with it:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
It only has top-level categories to categorise the feeds, not sub-categories
(and sub-sub-categories, etc.) like
<a href="http://akregator.kde.org/index.php">Akregator</a> (the feed reader
for KDE which I'm using at home) has.
</li>

<li>
Possibly as a result of it, or due to a different bug, it failed to properly
import the OPML file that akregator exported.
</li>

<li>
Bloglines displays many recent messages (200 or so) from the archive of
messages of the feed that it keeps in one huge page, that takes a lot of
time to load, and overloads the memory.
</li>

<li>
Some functions failed to work in Konqueror 3.5.x and I had to switch to Firefox.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
In short, I didn't find it good enough for me to use. I think I'll try
<a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> next and then maybe
try to install <a href="http://gregarius.net/">Gregarius</a> and see if I like
it. (even though I'd prefer a hosted solution).

<h2>2007-01-05: Book Review of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; by William Goldman</h2>

<p>
As mentioned <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/30213">in
a previous blog entry of mine</a> someone had bought me two books out of my
Amazon.com wishlist: "Perl Best Practices" and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345348036/ref=nosim/shlomifishhom-20">"The Princess Bride"</a>.
I've already read "Perl Best Practices" <a href="http://wiki.perl.org.il/index.php/Book_Review_-_Perl_Best_Practices_-_reviewed_by_Shlomi_Fish">and
reviewed it</a>. Recently I also finished reading "The Princess Bride", and
would like to review it here for completeness sake.
</p>

<p>
As you may know, The movie "The Princess Bride" is my favourite movie, and
someone on IRC told me the book was even better, so I looked forward to
read it. The book is well-written and kept me captivated. It's funny and
engaging. It's very different from the movie, and except for the necessary
parts that were omitted from the movie, is written in a different style.
I felt that some of the dialogues became sharper in the movie, but the
dialogues in the book are also good.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I'm not sure that I like it better than the movie, and feel
a bit disappointed. However, I can still highly recommend it.
</p>

<p>
More information about the book can be found
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride">in this Wikipedia
article</a>. Happy reading!

<h2>2007-01-05: KMail Tip: Quick Search Bar</h2>

<p>
I recalled finding the <a href="http://kmail.kde.org/">KMail</a> Quick Search
bar very convenient, but it has disappeared from my KMail installation some
time ago. Then I noticed it was present in my KMail installation at work, so
I decided to investigate. Turns out one can switch it on and off using the
"Settings &rarr; Show Quick Search" menu bar option.
</p>

<p>
The Quick Search bar is very useful: by setting the Status drop-down
to "Unread", one can see only the threads which have unread messages. One can
also filter based on other criteria. And naturally, one can also filter
according to search keywords. If you're using KMail, make sure you check it
out.

<h2>2007-01-05: Two Productive Days</h2>

<p>
Yesterday at work, I tried to configure the soundcard again, this time
using the Windows "Add New Hardware" wizard, and it still rebooted the
machine. Then my supervisor came and told me I can just use Linux for
what I need to do. So I did. So I was able to finally write some code. At
the end of the work day it compiled. Yay! I'm going to test it next week.
</p>

<p>
I left work early in order to go to
<a href="http://www.perl.org.il/meetings/2007/20070104.html">the
Israeli Perl Mongers meeting</a>. Since I arrived at home early, I did
some work on my old
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Graham-Function/">"Graham's
Function" Perl code</a>. Then I went to the meeting.
</p>

<p>
The meeting was very nice. Shmuel Fomberg gave an interesting talk about
Perl/Tk. It didn't renew too much to me, but it was still fun. Then Gabor
Szabo gave a talk about Perl 6, which from what I understood was a port of his
Perl 5 course to Perl 6. Several things there sparked a lot of discussion,
especially the junctions. For example, it turns out that in Perl 6
"if ((3|4) == 3) { ... }" will execute the condition, but so will
"if ((3|4) != 3) { ... }". That's because the "|" means "any", and so it
tests whether any of the operands is equal to 3 or whether any of them
is not. Another interesting feature is the chained conditionals:
"if (3 &lt; 7 == 7 &lt; 10 &gt; 8)" will evaluate to true in Perl 6.
</p>

<p>
I left the meeting prematurely along with my ride (Shmuel), so I may have
missed some more interesting stuff.
<a href="http://www.szabgab.com/perl6.html">The slides are online</a>,
however. I spent the rest of the evening reading the 2006 Perl Advent Calendar,
which while I took part in preparing, did not have a chance of fully reading
until then.
</p>

<p>
The whole work week was sunny and bright, but the weekend was and is going to
be stormy, so I cannot go out a lot. In any case, today I woke up relatively
early (before 9 AM), and decided to perform many outstanding tasks on the
computer. As it turned out, I performed quite a lot of them, and felt I was
very productive. Among the things I did were:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Schedule two upcoming Tel Aviv Linux Club lectures, after talking with the
future presenters.
</li>
<li>
Wrote 4 blog entries (in three different blogs) and decided against writing
on one topic I kept in my todo list.
</li>
<li>
Researched how to get <a href="http://sageshome.net/oss/qclam.php">QClam</a>
to connect to clamd instead of using clamscan, which is very resource
intensive - just tell it to use  <tt>clamdscan</tt> instead of
<tt>clamscan</tt>. I also hacked on QClam a bit in the process.
</li>
<li>
Added a new link to my "Stop Using Internet Explorer" page.
</li>
<li>
Read the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/216310/">latest "People behind
KDE" feature"</a>
</li>
<li>
Added some books to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/3K9IITLFAIUG2/wishlist">Amazon.com wishlist</a>.
</li>
<li>
Reported two bugs in perl-5.8.x.
</li>
<li>
Continued porting my Graham's Function program (see above) to Common Lisp. This
time I also dabbled a bit with creating new Lisp classes and methods.
</li>
<li>
Right now, I've started the upgrade process to upgrade my system to
<a href="http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=03940#0">Mandriva 2007.1 Alpha</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
So I think I can give myself a positive mental feedback for all this. Some
days I feel like I'm not doing anything, but that was certainly not the
case for these last two days.
</p>

<div class="entry">

<h2>2007-01-05: IceWM Exile</h2>

<p>
Well, the upgrade to Mandriva 2007.1 Alpha went relatively flawlessly. urpmi
was successful. However, then I ran into
<a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=27999">this
KWin (KDE's window manager) bug</a>, which made using KDE unusable for me. So
I've switched to using <a href="http://www.icewm.org/">IceWM</a> and am now
speaking from an IceWM exile. Nevertheless, I am still using all the nifty
KDE applications that I'm used to using so it's not that bad. I still miss the
KDE environment, though.
</p>

<p>
Today I've placed my
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits.html#qclam">QClam
modifications online</a>, and notified the author about it. I also installed
the Inkscape trunk,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1629444&amp;group_id=93438&amp;atid=604306">found a bug</a>,
and confirmed or said I could not reproduce a few others. I read LWN, and
added several links to the
<a href="http://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ViHumor">Vi Humour page on
the Text Editors' Wiki</a> (so no one should say that "Vi is serious.".).
</p>

<p>
I also tested bleadperl (The development version of perl5). I was able to
install the CPANPLUS bundle, but installing Task::Sites::ShlomiFish
was dead-on-arrival because of a Params::Validate compilation problem. I
didn't feel I was as productive as yesterday, but today things tended to get
in my way.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm off to write a report about the recent Perl Mongers meeting.

<h2>2007-01-10: Gtk+ Apps Tip: Eliminating the AP_SPI_REGISTRY Warnings</h2>

<p>
After I upgraded to Mandriva 2007.1 Alpha, I got the following warnings
whenever invoking gvim:
</p>

<pre>
Bonobo accessibility support initialized
GTK Accessibility Module initialized

** (vim:23983): WARNING **: AT_SPI_REGISTRY was not started at session startup.

** (vim:23983): WARNING **: IOR not set.

** (vim:23983): WARNING **: Could not locate registry
</pre>

<p>
They annoyed me because when running gvim from the command line, I want it
to be
<a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taouu/html/ch01s03.html#rule-silence">as silent as possible according to the "Silence is Golden" principle</a>. As
I found it it happens with all other Gtk+ apps. So I looked for a way to
eliminate them. There was nothing on the Mandriva bug tracker,
but a quick Google search yielded
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2006-November/msg00227.html">this
thread on the fedora-devel mailing list</a>.
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2006-November/msg00230.html">This
message there</a> yielded the following workaround:
</p>

<p>
<tt>gconftool-2 -s "/desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility" false --type bool</tt>
</p>

<p>
Now I'm no longer getting these warnings. Note that I don't know what is the
implication of the command, and it may cancel out accessibility altogether,
which may be critical for some users. You have been warned.

<h2>2007-01-11: Shell Tip: Finding All Executable Files under a Directory</h2>

<p>
In order to calculate a list of all files (not directories) with any of
the executable bits set in UNIX, one can use the following command:
</p>

<p>
<tt>find . -type f -perm /111</tt>
</p>

<p>
Note that a <tt>-perm</tt> argument that starts with "/" may be a GNU
extension, and <tt>find2perl</tt> at least does not accept it. In any case,
its meaning is to find files with any bit set.

<h2>2007-01-12: Tip: Possible Solution to an Ethernet LAN Throughput Drop</h2>

<p>
Recently, my home LAN experienced a sharp drop in the SMB throughput. I then
checked it with an HTTP transfer, and it was also very low (~800
Kilo-Bytes-per-second, or less than 10 Mega-bits-per-second). However, we were
able to resolve this by restarting our switch. Now our speeds are back to
their normal high.
</p>

<p>
So this solution may work for you too in case something like that happens.

<h2>2007-01-12: Finding a Lion in the Desert (and Other Mandriva Bugs)</h2>

<p>
How do you <a href="http://www.mathmaniacs.org/lessons/07-searching/">find a
lion in the desert</a>? You build a fence around the half of the
desert, the lion is found in and confine it to half of the desert. Then you
build another fence in the half of where the lion is to confine it to
a quarter of the desert, and another fence and another fence until you fully
confine the lion.
</p>

<p>
I've used this technique (otherwise known as Binary Search) to isolate
<a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=27999">this Mandriva bug</a>.
I knew that when running my configurtion of the KDE environment, my windows
jittered, while when not running the KDE windows manager, or in a new user's
KDE setup, everything was OK. And when moving away <tt>~/.kde</tt> it was
also OK. So I had to find what in .kde causes that.
</p>

<p>
At first I guessed it was some file in <tt>~/.kde/share/config</tt>. This was
indeed the case, as a fresh <tt>.kde</tt> with my original config directory
copied on top exhibited the problem. Then I incrementally copied files from
the "bad" <tt>config</tt> directory to the "good one". I started with a-j,
and l-z and they did not reproduce the problem, as most of the config files
start with k. Then I used several ranges of letters that start with k. So
I covered <tt>k[a-k]*</tt> (not reproduced), <tt>k[l-z]*</tt> (reproduced),
<tt>k[l-s]*</tt> (not reproduced), <tt>k[t-z]*</tt> (reproduced),
<tt>k[t-v]*</tt> (not reproduced), and <tt>k[w-z]*</tt> (reproduced). Then
I guessed it was probably <tt>kwinrc</tt> and indeed it reproduced the problem
alone.
</p>

<p>
Now, my <tt>kwinrc</tt> was long so I started deleting directives out of it
to further isolate the problem. After a long time of deleting and keeping
several "kwinrc.good" and "kwinrc.bad" files, I discovered that it happens
only with the Keramik windows style, and the focus-follows-mouse option. So
a workaround for that is to use a different windows' style. All of this took
a long time.
</p>

<p>
Other bugs I discovered:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=28086">a mikmod -n</a> bug -
this was an old bug in the libmikmod core code, which only surfaced on this
update. It was fixed since it was reported.
</li>

<li>
xine cannot play
<a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/shlomif/mods/airwolf.mod.zip">this MOD file</a>,
or <a href="http://www.modarchive.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi/A/airwolf.mod">this
one</a>, and probably many others. (As I discovered now,
<a href="http://www.modarchive.com/">MOD Archive</a> contains at least
7 different versions of the Airwolf theme, all of them different from what
I have. ) This bug was not reported yet.
</li>

<li>
<tt>mplayer -ao arts</tt> no logner works. This change was intentional and I
spoke with the packager who did it about it via email. mplayer without the
<tt>-ao</tt> flag or with <tt>-ao alsa</tt> works fine in KDE.
</li>

<li>
The Mandriva Galaxy (Classic) Theme flickers when the text in the title
decoration of the window changes. This is especially annoying with a new kmail
message that updates the title according to the subject. This bug was not
reported, either.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
On a different note, I ran Mandriva One on a machine at home, with AIGLX
enabled. The 3-D Windows' management effects are very cool!

<h2>2007-01-13: Windows 98 on a Computer with 2.5 GB of RAM</h2>

<p>
My current x86 computer originally had 512 MB of RAM and has a hard-disk
dedicated to Windows 98. However, recently I've been running Linux exclusively
on it, and also added another 2 GB of RAM. Today, my father needed to access
his old email, and so we needed to boot from Windows. I arranged a
<a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/Applications_GUI_Multimedia/Booting_Windows_on_second_HD_with_Grub">grub
boot configuration for it</a> and booted it. I upgraded the kernel to
2.6.20-rc5 so it came at the right time. Windows came up the logo was displayed,
but eventually a text message like "Insufficient memory to run Windows" was
displayed.
</p>

<p>
I tried to eliminate some problem - I cleared some space out of drive D
(normally used for data), set the BIOS to boot the Windows disk, and tried
again. Same problem. After discussing it with a friend and googling a bit,
I found <a href="http://www.computing.net/hardware/wwwboard/forum/46732.html">this
page</a> that says that win98 will "freak" if there is more than 2 GB of
memory.
</p>

<p>
If Windows 98 cannot handle more than 2 GB of memory that's fine, but why does
it have to freak with an incorrect error message. Can't it utilise only a
subset of this memory? Well, I guess that if we'd like to run Windows on this
machine again, we'll need to upgrade to Windows XP or whatever. Oh well.

<h2>2007-01-13: Exaile - Gtk+-based Amarok Clone</h2>

<p>
As I read <a href="http://lwn.net/">LWN</a> today, I learned about
<a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/01/03/2140240">Exaile, which
is a Gtk+-based clone of Amarok</a>. Amarok is the best Audio player I've
ever used, and so people who are not using KDE and would rather not run
Amarok which is KDE-based may wish to give Exaile a test drive. A caveat is
that I haven't tried Exaile myself, nor intend to, because I am using Amarok
on top of KDE and am pretty happy with this configuration.
</p>

<p>

<h2>2007-01-16: Tip: Extracting the Files out of an .rpm Package without Installing it</h2>


<p>
In order to extract the files out of an <a href="http://www.rpm.org/">.rpm</a>
package (a format for installable packages popular on Linux), without installing it, one can use the following command:
</p>

<pre>
rpm2cpio apache-base-2.2.2-0.1.20060mdk.i586.rpm |
    (mkdir -p unpacked ; cd unpacked ; cpio -i --make-directories)
</pre>

<p>
I've used the apache-base rpm as an example, so substitute its name. After
this command all the files contained in the RPM will be under the "unpacked"
directory. Enjoy!

<h2>2007-01-20: XML Tip: Namespaces</h2>

<p>
It is in fact possible to have an XML element of an undefined

a document with a default defined namespace. To do that one can use the
attribute <tt>xmlns=""</tt> on an element inside. So one must be prepared

<h2>2007-01-20: Tip: Incremental Devel-Cover Update</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Cover/">Devel-Cover</a> is a
Perl module to test for tests' coverage. What you do is run your test scripts
through it, and it gives you a report of which code was covered by them.
</p>

<p>
Now let's suppose you ran all your test scripts, and now modified one test
file in order to get better coverage. In this case, you may not need to
run everything again. Just do from the command line:
</p>

<pre>
# Run the test script through Devel::Cover.
# You can also use prove instead of runprove

HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES="-MDevel::Cover" runprove --blib t/0.9-strict.t

# Update the display.

It worked for me several times, and it's a huge time-saver.

<h2>2007-01-22: Google Reader (Web-based Feed Aggregators - Part 2)</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/27454.html">Having been looking for
a good web-based feed aggregator</a>, I decided to give
<a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> a try. Importing
my feeds from akregator was done successfully and I was able to fully utilise
the reader almost immediately. All in all, I found it extremely suitable
to what I need, and therefore decided to stick with it. The only (minor)
problems with it that I encountered so far are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
The page doesn't render too well in Konqueror from some reason. I have to use
Firefox for this.
</li>

<li>
Once the number of unread messages exceed 100, it only displays "100+" unread
messages and not the exact number. Since I'd like to know exactly how many
unread messages I have left to read, I find this mis-feature sub-optimal. But
I can live with it.
</li>

<li>
Google Reader seems to use tags instead of nested categories. So if in
akregator, a feed appeared in the Perl sub-category inside the Blogs category,
it will appear under both the Perl and Blogs top-level categories in
Google Reader. This seems much less useful than having nested categories.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
But like I said, I found what I'm looking for, and am going to stop now. So
I'm happily using Google Reader to stay keep up with my feeds.

An online friend referred me to

accompanying videoclip on YouTube</a> ("Starz in Their Eyes" by "Just Jack"),
and to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FwEQKiMmLA">Voodoo Child

</p>

<p>
If you're interested in hearing some geek gangsta rap look no further
than <a href="http://www.mikseri.net/artists/?id=19062">Leech Axss</a>. So
far I liked his "Hax That F**k" song. Another geek song is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060502044952/http://cafe.colorado.edu/~tromey/other.html">the

<h2>2007-01-22: Bash History Problem (and its Workaround)</h2>

<p>
On my system, I have set bash to have 25,000 lines of bash history, instead
of the usual default. Whether because of that or due to some other reason,
I sometimes encounter a problem where the history gets reset to a very small
number of lines, which makes it unusable. I decided to workaround the problem
like this:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
I set up a local Subversion repository to hold the history of the history
file. (Using <tt>svnadmin</tt>).
</li>

<li>
I committed the initial copy of a good bash history file inside.
</li>

<li>

<p>
I set up the following cronjob:
</p>

<pre>
22 * * * *   bash /home/shlomi/bin/backup-bash-history.bash
</pre>

<p>
That runs every hour and runs the following script:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
backup_base="$HOME/Backup/bash-history"
trunk="$backup_base/trunk"
# The \cp and -f is to overwrite the file
\cp -f "$HOME/.bash_history" "$trunk/bash-history/bash_history"
svn commit -q -m \
    "Commiting the bash_history as of $(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S)" \
    "$trunk"
</pre>

<p>
Which copies the bash history file over to the local copy and commits it into
the repository.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since I started using this setup 9 days ago, my bash history did not get reset.
Maybe Satan knows he's being watched?

<h2>2007-01-27: Local host no longer 'localhost'</h2>

<p>
Well, until now I've been too lazy to change my Linux workstations'
hostname to anything except localhost.localdomain. However, lately, as I
went over the ssh public keys I left in the <tt>authrized_keys</tt> file of
my remote servers, I realised that I could not tell which machine each key
belonged to, because they all had the hostname "localhost.localdomain" on
them.
</p>

<p>
A meaningful hostname identification may be advantageous in other similar
contexts. Thus, I changed my home's hostname to
<tt>telaviv1.shlomifish.org</tt> and my work's to
<tt>shlomif1.tehutinetworks.co.il</tt>. This way, I can better manage my
SSH keys, know where everything came from, and properly identify the machine
on which scripts run. No localhost for you!

<h2>2007-01-27: Tip: Inner Functions in Common Lisp</h2>

<p>
A common paradigm in <a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme</a>, and
other functional programming languages is to have helper functions (or
inner functions or closures) inside top-level functions:
</p>

<pre>
(define (sum mylist)
  (define (helper rest result)
    (if (null? rest)
      result
      (helper (cdr rest) (+ result (car rest)))))
  (helper mylist 0))

(display (sum '(5 6 150)))
(newline)
</pre>

<p>
Here, we have a <tt>sum</tt> function, which calls defines a recursive
<tt>helper</tt> function inside and then calls it. I tried to do the same
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common Lisp</a> using
a nested <tt>(DEFUN)</tt> but instead got a warning
from the compiler: <q>STYLE-WARNING: redefining HELPER in DEFUN </q>. As it
turns out, <tt>(DEFUN)</tt>
inside a function still defines a function on the outer scope. To achieve
the same in Common Lisp, one has to use the
<a href="http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/Body/speope_fletcm_scm_macrolet.html">FLET
or LABELS forms</a>. FLET defines several inner function that cannot refer to
themselves (or can only refer to the previous ones), and LABELS allows
self-reference. (Thanks for Riastradh from Freenode for pointing me to them.)
</p>

<p>
So the equivalent code in Common Lisp would be:
</p>

<pre>
(defun sum (mylist)
  (labels
    (
     (helper (%rest result)
             (if (null %rest)
               result
               (helper (cdr %rest) (+ result (car %rest))))))
    (helper mylist 0)))

(format t "~A~%" (sum '(5 6 150)))
</pre>

<h2>2007-01-28: Vim tip: Searching for the word under the cursor</h2>

<p>
A vim tip that I learned from my supervisor at work today is this: you can
search for the next occurence of the word under the cursor
<a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/pattern.html#star">using
"*"</a>. There's also "#" which searches backwards, and there are other search
commands which seem useful on the same page.
</p>

<p>
If you want to jump to a tag you generated using ctags you can use the "Ctrl+]"
or the ":tag" commands (":tag" can be abbreviated to ":ta").
</p>

<p>
And I'll leave you with the following vim macro which I wrote. See if you can
guess what it does. I inserted some linebreaks but there are none in the
original version.
</p>

<pre>
map &lt;F2&gt; i&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;div class="entry" title="&lt;CR&gt;
&lt;ESC&gt;!$date +\%Y-\%m-\%d&lt;CR&gt;k$Jx$a: &lt;ESC&gt;mda"&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;

<h2>2007-02-01: Vim Tip: Jumping to Positions in Other Files using Uppercase Marks</h2>

<p>
In <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> lowercase
<a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#mark-motions">marks</a>
are specific to each file, while uppercase marks are global. Thus, one can
type <tt>mA</tt>, <tt>mB</tt>, <tt>mC</tt> etc. to set such a mark in
a certain position in a fileand then use
<tt>`A</tt> or <tt>'A</tt> to jump to it even from a different file. This
is useful to keep several bookmarks in several files and jump from one to
another.
</p>

<p>
Since one can use <tt>`</tt> and <tt>'</tt> as a motion command, I'm not
sure how a jump to an uppercase mark from a different file is useful as
an argument to a motion-accepting command such as <tt>y</tt> or <tt>d</tt>.
However uppercase marks are still useful for what I demonstrated.

<h2>2007-02-01: Vim Tip: t/f/F/T</h2>

<p>
Third Vim tip in a row on this blog (must be a record for me) and this time a
blast from the past. Well, at least something I learned a long time ago, but
many people are not aware of.
</p>

<p>
By using the "f" command and then a character one can move to the next
occurence of that character on the same line. So "ts" will move to the
next occurence of the letter "s". "t" is the same except it moves to the
character before that. "F" and "T" are for moving backwards. You can specify
an optional count for jumping to the N'th occurence in the same line.
</p>

<p>
This for example is useful for quickly selecting tokens. If for example,
you have a C-style string delimited by double-quotes, you can position your
character to its start using the "f" command and then right (The right arrow
key or "l"), and then select up to the end of the string using <tt>yt"</tt>
, or alternatively replace it with something else using <tt>ct"</tt>.
Alternatively, one can select the string including the quotes, by positioning
the cursor at the opening quote and typing <tt>yf"</tt>.
</p>

<h2>2007-02-02: Rant: LiveJournal's Menus Don't Work with Konqueror</h2>

<p>
I've reported the fact that LiveJournal's new JavaScript drop-down menus no
longer work properly in <a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a> (at
least not versions 3.5.x), which is my browser of choice to the LJ support.
They work perfectly fine in Mozilla Firefox 2.0, but I don't suppose they can
afford to ignore such a popular and universal browser.
</p>

<p>
The problem still exists. I'm still not sure if it's a Konqueror limitation
for which a workaround is in place, or a non-standard code on the part inside
LiveJournal. The Post button still works (thanks god) and that's most of
what I need, but it's still annoying that I cannot use the menus.
</p>

<p>
Now I'll try to ask on the IRC if anyone knows what causes the problem. And
I wonder whether it affects Safari on Mac OS X.

<h2>2007-02-07: Vim Tip: Using Registers in the Command Line Mode</h2>

<p>
I have several vim tips in the pipe, so I think I'll start with one. If you're
editing commands in the ex-like Command Line Mode of vim (the one that's
displayed after you press ":" in Normal Mode), you can use the
<a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/cmdline.html#c_CTRL-R">Ctrl+R
family of keybindings to insert registers and other text there</a>. So for
example, if you wish to search for a word, you can do <tt>yaw</tt> in the
buffer, and then type <tt>:grep -r &lt;CTRL+R&gt;" .</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Since this pattern is so common, the vim developers already thought of it, and
you can simply position the cursor on the word and type
<tt>:grep -r &lt;CTRL+R&gt;&lt;CTRL+W&gt; .</tt>. Ctrl+R;Ctrl+A searches for
WORDS.
</p>

<p>
Note that Ctrl+R by default executes the pasted expression as a mini vim
program. If you want to insert the literal string, use Ctrl+R;Ctrl+R. Better
safe than sorry.

<h2>2007-02-08: Vim Tip: Useful Buffers Commands</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> supports the concept of buffers, which
are basically separate files that you can edit simultaneously in the same
editor instance. I normally used the commands <tt>:bn</tt> (next buffer),
<tt>:bp</tt> (previous buffer) and <tt>:bd</tt> (delete buffer), but I
discovered other useful ones a few days ago.
</p>

<p>
One can display a list of buffers using the <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/windows.html#:buffers"><tt>:buffers</tt> command, which can
also be abbreviated as <tt>:ls</tt></a>. Besides each buffer is a number. One
can then use the
<a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/windows.html#:b"><tt>:b
$NUMBER</tt> command</a> to switch to that buffer. Note that if you're using
gvim then the Buffers drop-down menu (Alt+B) will display a list of buffers
with their numbers and will allow you to select a buffer to switch.
</p>

<p>
I'm off to a friend's wedding. Happy vimming!

<h2>2007-02-10: PostNuke tip: Pruning/Filtering the Submitted Stories/Articles Queue</h2>

<p>
I have a PostNuke installation over at iglu.org.il, which receives many story
submissions that contain nothing but spam. In order to help me get rid of
all of them, I wrote a
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize/">WWW-Mechanize</a> script
that deletes the submitted stories/articles from the queue one by one. However,
it took it a long time to even delete one article, even when running on the
localhost.
</p>

<p>
After looking at the PostNuke code, I realised that the table "pn_queue"
(where "pn_" is the prefix of your PostNuke tables) contain these articles.
So I tried running "<tt>DELETE FROM pn_queue</tt>" in the MySQL shell, and it
indeed worked and pruned my queue. If you're interested in filtering only
selected articles, you can use an SQL WHERE clause. This statement finishes
in a shorter time than it takes my WWW-Mechanize script to delete one article.
</p>

<p>
That put aside, I'm looking for a better way to prevent spam from being
submitted to the PostNuke queue in the first place.
</p>

<p>
On a slightly different note, I'd like to add that one should not copy
binary executables that were compiled on a Mandriva Cooker system to a
Debian Sarge system, because they are incompatible. I may have lost some
of mail completely for several hours, because I did that with
<a href="http://sageshome.net/oss/qclam.php">QClam</a>, which caused it
to segfault with a strange error.

<h2>2007-02-10: Which Pages Link to Your Site using the Google Webmaster Tools</h2>

<h2>2007-02-17: What to do when your Internet Connection is Down?</h2>

<p>
In the last two days there have been frequent Internet outages for ADSL
subscribers in Central Israel. Today I've been stuck working on the computer
with no Internet connection for a few hours after I woke up. At first it was
maddening as I couldn't find anything worthy to do. But then I worked on my
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">homesite</a> by working on the Subversion
working copy. I had added many descriptions to presentations, revamped existing
pages, and converted my Hebrew and English bio to use the same source.
</p>

<p>
So it kept me busy and distracted when the Internet was down. Still, having
no Internet connection feels like I'm missing a limb.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> as I was going to post this entry, I got disconnected again.
&lt;sigh /&gt;. After I wrote this entry I spent some time on my unified

<ol>
<li>
To indent the inside of a block (after a copy and paste for example)
use <tt>&gt;i}</tt> or <tt>&lt;i}</tt>. It beats writing
<tt>&gt;%</tt> and then doing <tt>&lt;&lt;%&lt;&lt;</tt>
</li>
<li>
To change a string use <tt>ci"</tt>.
</li>
<li>
To delete a block use <tt>da}</tt>.
</li>
<li>
To copy a paragraph use <tt>yap</tt>.
</li>

<h2>2007-02-22: Who said Weblogs were not Useful?</h2>

<p>
Some people believe writing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">a

disproves it. A while ago,
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/27316.html">I ranted about my failed
attempt to get the sound to work on my work's Windows system</a>. Well,
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/27316.html?thread=24244#t24244">someone
replied to it</a>. It took me time to digest his message, but a few days
ago when I followed its advice, I was able to get my sound to work.
</p>

<p>
So posting this rant on my blog benefitted me in helping me resolve the
problem. And this is not including the times when I found answers to problems
I had on people's blogs where they posted after resolving them and helped me
as well (but probably not directly themselves).
</p>

<p>
So if you have a technical problem - blog about it (not before

<h2>2007-03-03: Pal-Kal</h2>

<p>
A while ago the top story in Israel was about the floor of an events hall,
that collapsed during a wedding causing many casualties. Now, this floor was
built using an Israeli invented construction method called "Pal-Kal", and
as a result Pal-Kal became a synonym for an inherently bad technology. For
example <a href="http://tddpirate.livejournal.com/">tddpirate</a> often says
"MS-Windows is the Pal-Kal of the PC world." in his email signatures. (see for
instance
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il%40cs.huji.ac.il/msg39953.html">this
message</a>),
and once during a conversation when we discussed developing programs in
Visual Basic, someone said it results in "The Pal-Kal effect".
</p>

<p>
However, it is possible this entire phrase is mis-attributed. The floor of the
hall probably collapsed because several columns were removed some time after
the construction, and not because it was built using the Pal-Kal method. As
further evidence, many other Israeli buildings have been constructed using it,
and all these building have been fine since the accident has occurred.
</p>

<p>
So now we have to find an alternative to "Pal-Kal".
<a href="http://www.cafepress.com/nucleartacos.26229228">This shirt</a> says
"MySQL is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Me">WinME</a> of
Databases". However, "MS-Windows is the Windows ME of the PC World" makes
little sense. I guess for better or for worse Pal-Kal is going to stick
regardless of how much factual its origin is.

<h2>2007-03-05: I Know What You Did Last Weekend</h2>

<p>
Previously, I had contemplated taking a Thursday off so I'll have an extended
weekend at home for concentrated hacktivity. However, because of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim">Purim</a> we were given this
Sunday off, and we also have a 9-day vacation on Passover starting the 1 of
April. So I guess I'll
delay this plan.
</p>

<p>
So without further ado, here are some of the things I did this weekend:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
I went biking once on Friday and once on Sunday. It's been a few weeks since
I last biked, and it felt good to do it again. On Sunday I crossed the Yarkon
river to ride on the other side. This time I was able to cross it again, on
the "Rosh Hatzipor" bridge.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Chatted on the IRC and on Instant Messenging. I did too much IRC chat for
my own good, but it was a lot of fun. Now I think I have IRC hangover.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/32554">I prepared Mandriva
RPMs for XML::Feed and its dependencies</a>. My next plans are to prepare RPMs
for <a href="http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/rlwrap/">rlwrap</a>. I'd like to
pack the dependencies of the pugs and then the CPAN dependencies of
<a href="http://www.pugscode.org/">pugs</a>' "make smoke" target but one of
the modules there requires a newer version of "Test Harness" than the one
that is present in perl-5.8.8 and is placed in the Mandriva "perl"
distribution. If anyone has any good ideas on how to resolve this problem,
please let me know.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
I backed up the hard-disk. New month, new backup.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Blogged.
</p>
</li>

<li>

<h2>2007-03-06: Three Vim Tips</h2>

<p>
More silly <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> tips! In order to make your
search case-insensitive use the <tt>\c</tt> modifier. In order to have vim
display line numbers use <tt>:set nu</tt>. And speaking of the <tt>:set</tt>
options, you can use <tt>:set nu!</tt> (with a trailing question-mark)
to toggle the option between on and off, <tt>:set nu?</tt> to query its
status, and <tt>:set nonu</tt> (with a leading "no") to set it off.

<p>
Happy vimming!

<h2>2007-03-09: What I Did Today</h2>

<p>
Today I spent the morning doing several small computer-related errands:
sending emails, updating web-sites, and cleaning up my
<a href="http://vipe.technion.ac.il/">vipe</a> home directory.
</p>

<p>
Then I updated the packages in my Mandriva Cooker system, and as I went to
read the <a href="http://lwn.net/">LWN.net</a> feed, found out there's
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/224983/">a new -rc kernel</a>. So I decided
to upgrade to it, while I was at it. After compiling it and running
"make modules_install" and "make install" as root, I rebooted the machine.
Trying the new kernel did not work and it complained about being unable to
mount /dev/sda1, and before that about a bad initrd. My trusty Mandriva One
CD to the rescue, and I found that there are .old initrd's files in the
/boot directory, and moved one of them on top of the new initrd. Then I was
able to boot it? But why did "make install" cause that.
</p>

<p>
I started debugging the bootloader scripts to see why the hanged, and found
out the culprit was with a broken gunzip and zcat. As it turned out they
<a href="http://archives.mandrivalinux.com/cooker/2007-03/msg02091.php">broke
on Mandriva Cooker</a>. I talked about it with the guy who broke it on the
IRC, and he told me he uploaded an update (which wasn't on the mirrors back
then). So, per advice from someone else on the IRC, I downgraded to the
2007.0 gzip package, and used it to install the kernel properly
(2.6.21-rc3-git4 this time, as I tried to see if it fixed the problem I
was having.).
</p>

<p>
This took the other half of the day, and kept me busy. In any case, there's
now an
<a href="http://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk/mirrors/Mandriva/devel/cooker/i586/media/main/release/gzip-1.3.11-2mdv2007.1.i586.rpm">updated
gzip package</a> so if you're on Cooker/Mandriva 2007.1 and have the
gzip-1.3.11-1mdv2007.1 package, then make sure you upgrade.
</p>

<p>
Today I was also able to catch up with my huge
<a href="http://userfriendly.org/">User Friendly</a> backlog (of over a
year), and to read (or otherwise mark as read) all the RSS feeds in Google
Reader. So it wasn't completely wasted.

<h2>2007-03-13: Facts I Discovered in my Log Analyzer Report</h2>

<p>
As it turns out, Internet Explorer 5.0 accounts for 21.34% of the hits on
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">my homesite</a> in February. That's
strange because I figure most people are using Internet Explorer 6.0 or 7.0
by now. Maybe it's caused by changing the browser identification. Firefox is
second place with 19.11% of the hits. :-). The MSNBot spider generated 12.40%
of the traffic, vs. Googlebot's 3.32%.
</p>

<p>
An even cooler fact is that I discovered my web site contains the first hit
for
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=about+myself&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">a
Google search on the query "about myself"</a>. I wonder how long it will last.

<h2>2007-03-23: &quot;Those who can - do; those who can't - complain&quot;</h2>

<p>
I always thought that "Those who can - do; those who can't - complain." was said
or at least attributed to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>.
However, I could not find any place in Google with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22those+who+can+do%22+%22those+who+can%27t+complain%22+linus+torvalds&amp;btnG=Search">this search</a>. Then
I looked for it in Google Groups and as the oldest found
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.emacs/browse_frm/thread/ff5c9db8fefb1d97/0f3caf113d558fea?lnk=st&amp;q=%22those+who+can%27t+-+complain%22&amp;rnum=85&amp;hl=en#0f3caf113d558fea">this post to comp.emacs by an obscure "Jonn
Beudin"</a> where he says it in 14 August 1989, three years before the Linux
kernel effort started and Linus Torvalds became posted and started posting.
</p>

<p>
The post reads:
</p>

<pre>
I think you owe the implementors of emacs an appology. You have very
clearly not made an attempt to read the documentation. Instead you
flame. Please be more considerate in the future. I feel bad when I read
about freeloaders (:-) like yourself cutting up something they didn't
contribute to. I use emacs and am damn glad some people had the generosity
and sense to post it. "Those who can, do; those who can't, complain."
</pre>

<p>
So it wasn't Linux originally after all. I wonder if the quotes there are
meant to quote another source, or are the "It's an aphorism" indicator. So it
may possibly be a meme.
</p>

<p>
I found many other variations on the <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw#Maxims_for_Revolutionists">"He
who can, does. He who cannot, teaches"</a> on Google, some of them <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot
related</a>. However, the Shaw original is not true, as teaching requires even
more effort to do properly than doing something productive. The Talmud says
"I learned a lot from my teachers, more from my friends, and from my students,
the most of all." Teaching is the best way of learning, and I'm speaking
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/">from
experience</a>.

<h2>2007-03-26: Cool Cats</h2>

<p>
There's a tri-color (probably female) cat hanging around the Coffee to Go,
at the main entrance to <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/">Tel Aviv
University</a>. What she does is pass through the people sitting there, eating
and drinking, while possibly looking for leftovers to eat. She's pretty
friendly.
</p>

<p>
There's a cat at the lawn outside the university right near the
"Social Studies building". I can see him (or her) consistenly when biking
through on Haim Levanon st. He's usually sitting on the edge of the stone
fence, just resting.
</p>

<p>
When I passed through the other day, he was on the sidewalk, and acting
strange, going around in circles. Maybe he was looking for something. I got
off the bike and patted him (he let me), but he wasn't content with it either.
</p>

<p>
There's a female cat in Schreiber in TAU (where we hold the Tel Aviv Linux
club presentations). People call her "Bruriyah" and she is considered the
"Be'alim" (= owner) of Shcreiber. She's half-black half-white and not
tri-color.

<h2>2007-03-28: Message from the Messiah to the Hizbullah</h2>

<p>
Dear members of the Hizbullah,
</p>

<p>
You are the party of God - you have declared yourself to be the chosen,
the selected, the noble - the ones who've chosen to follow Allah out of their
own free will, and for the betterment of all his followers. Yet, Nasarallah
is nothing but a conduit - he follows the order of the Syrians and Iranians and
transfers them to you. Who gives them these orders? The Syrians are led by the
generals, who have nothing but a fake and diminishing ego (a.k.a self-esteem)
to  guide them. Iran is led by the Ayattulahs who believe they are guided by
Allah, but are in fact guided by their own weak awarenesses and by the politics
and control of their fellows. Hitler did not control the other Nazi leaders,
as much as he was controlled by them. Neither is any single Ayatalluh.
</p>

<p>
Listen to me! I am <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a>. The
man. The legend.
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/">The Eternal
Jew</a>. I am <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/the-eternal-jew/change_the_world.html#i_am_the_messiah">the Messiah</a>, and
I am <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/the-eternal-jew/most_powerful_man.html">the
most Powerful man on Earth</a>. I have studied and perfected the arts of
applied Ethics, applied learning and applied logic. Follow me, and become
a Messiah as well!
</p>

<p>
You were always told to follow God, and be a good person, because God can
punish you. However, God will not punish you no matter what you do. Instead,
you should follow God out of his love: it feels good to be good. It feels
good to do good things. It feels good to be productive and independent. Then,
and only then, it feels good to be alive. Your "leaders" do no good, so they
are miserable and wish everyone else to be. Don't listen to them!
</p>

<p>
I accept only orders from God. By God, I mean, the absolute reality, logic,
and ethics. I am fully in control of myself, and God is by my side. Nasarallah
and friends, on the other hand, are completely out of control. They cannot
control themselves, yet they believe they can control others.
</p>

<p>
I, the Messiah, orders you to immediately stop this nonsense, and ditch
your "elite" for being the idiotic, incompetent, cowards they are. Throw them
to the streets, but do not harm them in any way. Justice should be pursued at
almost all costs. Revenge, on the other, should be avoided. I wouldn't
kill someone who killed one man, or someone who killed a million people. They
deserve to live forever like everyone else, and after having to act like
benevolent people for enough time, they too will become ones, and will regret
their past acts. This is real justice.
</p>

<p>
Your leaders tell you that after you die you will gain eternal life in
paradise. But how can you know that this is the case? Your mind cannot survive
without your body. So death means sleeping without ever waking up. It means
the eternal termination of your consciousness. Nothing can be scarier.
</p>

<p>
With me, I suggest you a better idea: let's work together on having
youth-rejuvanating biological immortality. This way you can be young forever,
while not contradicting the laws of nature. It cannot be done by killing
people, but it can be done by freedom, the joy of creation, happiness and,
yes, Capitalism. Perhaps you'll die before achieving this. But at least you'll
have a long, happy and productive life, instead of the short and
unsatisfying life as a peon at the control of the stupid and weak.
</p>

<p>
Once Lebanon is liberated,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/solving/">Solving</a> will move
on to achieve bigger goals. First we'll take Tehran. Then we'll take Beijing.
Vampires of the world, unite!

<h2>2007-03-28: I Got Fired</h2>

<p>
This news is a bit, but I've been fired on Monday. I'd not reveal the full
details here, but can say that it was because it seems we were incompatible. I
found it a bit shocking because I actually liked this job, learned many new
things, the pay was good, the people were friendly and often amusing, and they
were very professional as far as technical excellence were concerned. I wish
them the best of luck.
</p>

<p>
My main problem (and the reason I got fired) was that they were relatively
clueless as far as software management was concerned. In fact, they were not
up to date with most of the contemporary advice I was familiar with, (most
of which I found very good):
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral
and the Bazaar</a> and other relevant
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/">writings by ESR</a>.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/links.html#software_gurus">Others</a>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
As usual, taking these things with a grain of salt is necessary. All of them
together may be contradictory. However, taking some good advice is good
because "you should always learn from other people's mistakes - you won't
have time to do them all yourself". I gave my boss at the workplace this list,
which I'll hope he'll read as much as possible from.
</p>

<p>
Right now, I'm not looking for another full time job, but rather want to work
on a <a href="http://winapt.berlios.de/">top-secret project</a>, and
catch up with my essay ideas and other blogging, as well as, hopefully, do
some coding. If you can offer me short-term gigs doing something that
hopefully will not take too much time to become good, I'm all ears. If you
want to interest me with work for no payment, or for very low pay (like
50 NIS/hour), forget it - my time is far too precious.
</p>

<p>
I'm feeling a bit relieved and disappointed now at the same time. Hopefully,
I'll get over the disappointed and lousy feeling part.

<h2>2007-03-29: Ubuntu and the &quot;Not Invented Here Syndrome&quot;</h2>

<p>
Maybe it's just me, but I believe Ubuntu and Canonical have a severe case of
the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here">Not Invented Here</a>.
Instead of building on one of the three most suitable distributions at the
time (each with advantages, disadvantages and often trade-offs):
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>,
and <a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva Linux (formerly Mandrake
Linux)</a> and MEPIS, they have forked Debian, and created an improved but
incompatible
version. Furthermore, they have their own proprietary web-based translation
tool, their own proprietary bug-tracker (what's wrong with Bugzilla, Trac, or
Request Tracker), they had two version control system ("Bazaar" and
"Bazaar-NG"), which aimed to combine "the best advantages of all the rest",
and wrote many system utilities from scratch.
</p>

<p>
The worst thing is that they are burning money fast. Mandriva used to be
profitable for a while, and could have been more if it had a better management
when it started. And <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> is very
profitable. All the distributions I mentioned (including Ubuntu) are open
source and may survive the going-away of their parent company, either by a
new company being established, or by the community working on it. By
open-source I don't mean the FSF-fanatical view in which every component
must be free software, but rather the fact that it can be bootstrapped and
usable using FOSS exclusively.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu has done some things well: good hardware detection and integration,
viral marketing, positive hype, etc. <a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php/My_Favorite_Distribution_-_Shlomi_Fish#Debian">Debian
has its own share of problems</a>, but I still think it's more independent
and economically-sound and less NIH-syndromed than Ubuntu is. So I guess from
now on, I'll use Debian instead of Ubuntu when I do (i.e: when I'm not using
Mandriva or Fedora or whatever), and recommend everyone to do the same.
</p>

<p>
Some people think Ubuntu is perfect. It may be very polished, but it
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ubuntu+problems">has its share
of problems</a>. I think Debian is actually better in this regard with its
rigid quality control. No one can deny Mandriva has bugs, but they have
<a href="http://qa.mandriva.com/">a public bug-tracker</a>, and they fix
these bugs. I guess fast-moving and bug-free are often trade-offs.
</p>

<p>
So stay cool, be independent, think for yourself but cooperate with others,
and don't be "Ubuntu". Cheers.
</p>

<h2>2007-03-31: People Talking on the IRC: 'Hot Ugly Chicks'</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://aharoni.wordpress.com/">Aharoni in Unicode</a> has a series
of "People Talking" series, so I'm starting a "People Talking on the IRC"
series. Here's the first entry:
</p>

<pre>
   &lt;mofino&gt;  yeah women are fantastic
   &lt;mofino&gt;  all of them
   &lt;mofino&gt;  even the uglies
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  mofino: I suppose.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  I know some hot ugly chicks.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  Or at least cool ones.
   &lt;mofino&gt;  hehe
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  "hot ugly chick"?
   &lt;mofino&gt;  women have special abilities
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: I mean hot as in attractive.
   &lt;mofino&gt;  they are mom's at heart
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  JavaWoman: here?
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  rindolf: Yes, that is the usual definition.
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  How did you mean "ugly" then?
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: physically, unappealing.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  fat, ugly face, etc.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  Unkempt perhaps.
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  So they are physically attractive, but physically
             unattractive?
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: no.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  They are sexually attractive, but physically unattractive.
   &lt;mofino&gt;  hehe
   &lt;mofino&gt;  cool
   &lt;mofino&gt;  digging a chick for her personality
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: couldn't you figure it out?
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  I find this distinction odd.
   &lt;mofino&gt;  jagerman, this is why you are single
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: I'm not saying I'd like to date them.
   &lt;mofino&gt;  nice girls are girls too
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  No, I'm single because I am a chickenshit.
   &lt;mofino&gt;  sluts need love too
   &lt;mofino&gt;  just much more
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  Some beautiful girls are complete bitches.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  And some of them smoke. :-)

<h2>2007-04-06: The Ultimate Cause of Human Life</h2>

<p>
We had the following discussion on IRC. Comments included:
</p>

<pre>
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: I think the ultimate cause for humans is
             happiness, not to procreate.
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  Cause?
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: have you read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a>"?
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  At least the first part.
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  No
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  If I write now, it's to talk to you.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  Why do I talk to you?
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  To have fun.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  And why do I want to have fun?
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  To feel good about myself.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  So what's the ultimate cause?
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  According to Aristotle it's happiness.
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  Because I might, in some small way, help you become more
             successful, thereby allowing you to better attract a female
             to have sex with.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: not everything we do has to do with sex.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  It's a common fallacy.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  Some people don't have sex at all.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  Like priests, or monks.
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  Yes, and those people are removed from evolutionary
             contribution to the species.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  And yet they are very happy and active.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: right.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: but look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa">Mother Theresa</a>.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  For example.
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  Whether or not the ideal species is concerned with sex, the
             point is that the successful part of the human race does
             not avoid having sex.
 &lt;jagerman&gt;  Mother Theresa did a great disservice to society by not
             having children who might have carried her genes and
             continued her work.
</pre>

<p>
Have you noticed the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(logic)">non-sequitur</a>
here? We were talking about why people do what they do, not whether what they
are doing is good. But let's go on:
</p>

<pre>
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  jagerman: assuming Mother theresa indeed did such greater
             work, then I would say that:
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  1. It was OK for her not to have children. It's her choice.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  2. I'm not sure her children would have been as good as
             her.
</pre>

<p>
Some things are not inherited. Being noble is something a man develops.
Furthermore, the human race being very intelligent and conscious, no longer
applies to the same biology that applies to insects. Even mammals (which may
not be conscious) do many things that have nothing to do with procreation,
due to their intelligence. Humans do everything they do for self-esteem
and being happy, not for procreating. This is despite what Sigmund Freud
(which I heavily despise and which
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#feeling_good">"Feeling
Good" by David D. Burns</a> (a wonderful pop-psychology book which is a
self-help book for cognitive psychology) keeps deprecating.

<h2>2007-04-07: Ruby-Israel Meeting Impressions and Advice</h2>

<p>
Yesterday I attended the first Israeli
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> enthusiasts meeting. Despite many
problems in its organisation - it was very successful. It was in the format of
a barbeque in a villa in Hertzliyah, an informal chat, an informal introduction
and then a round of some future expectations and planning. Since the meeting
is currently hosted at Google Groups (%-)), and I'm subscribed there
from my gmail.com account which I also dislike, here are my impressions and
pieces of advice.
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of good advice in <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Linux_PR/newlug.html">Rick Moen's "Recipe for a Succesful Linux User Group"</a> and I
suggest that people go over it, because while the Rubyers seem enthusiastic,
they've made some classical mistakes.
</p>

<p>
First of all, instead of saying "Israel.rb" in the email headers, which
may be the conventional name, one should say "Ruby Israel" or "Ruby-IL" which
more people understand what it is. While the Ruby mongers can refer to
themselves as "Israel.rb", they should make sure people who encounter it
somewhere immediately know what it is about.
</p>

<p>
Memo to self: try to get us hosting at <a href="http://www.tau.ac.il/">Tel Aviv
University</a> (TAU). I can walk there from home. We agreed that the format of
the villa was not good enough for presentations, for which we needed a screen,
a projector and some seats. There are plenty of rooms like this in TAU, and we
can try get one. TAU is also more accessible and in a better location than most
other places, as Tel Aviv is the center of transportation in Israel and TAU is
well connected.
</p>

<p>
I talked with someone there (forgot his name) who has read almost all of
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">"Joel on Software"</a>,
and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a>. I found that I
could discuss stuff like
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000054.html">the
Chicken and Egg problem</a> or what Joel said in an interview about the fact
that now Microsoft has an overhead of 90% (like in the Army where you have to
clean the weapons, brush the shoes, etc. instead of actually training.) So
it was refreshing finding someone whom I shared many metaphors with, which
made communication much easier. On the way back my ride told me this thing
was enabled by some popular online cultures (like Joel on Software) and as I
said it previously happend with enthusiasts of various philosophers, authors,
etc.
</p>

<p>
Someone (perhaps the same guy) also told me he got his job from an opening
on Joel's job board, and that his company are using FogBUGZ, which is Joel's
company's bug tracker. As we discussed,
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000056.html">sometimes
you can simply create a competitive product in a market with many
competitors</a>, and still make a lot of money, and add many innovative
features. FogBUGZ has a lot of competition, including some excellent
open-source packages, but people are still buying it. And no, I haven't used
it yet, and my favourite bug tracking package so far is
<a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned the <a href="http://perl-begin.berlios.de/">Perl Beginners'
Site</a> which I tried to orient arond a marketing approach. Comments are
welcome.
</p>

<p>
I mentioned <a href="http://www.garageband.com/">Garage Band</a> which is
a hub for music by unsigned or independent artists. My favourite artist there
is <a href="http://www.garageband.com/artist/JennaDrey">Jenna Drey</a> whose
style is Rock, Pop and Dance. Garage Band allows artists to release tracks as
mp3s, compete with other artists, maintain a weblog, etc. Drey for example
signed with an Indie label after she became successful there.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.kleinfour.com/">The Klein Four Group</a> are a group of
five mathematics students from Northwestern University who perform
math-oriented parodies. You should look at the video and/or lyrics for their
"Finite Simple Group (of Order Two)" and "Just the Four of Us" songs, which
are available on their site. Another very funny video is
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM">Rob
Paravonian's Pachelbel's Rant</a>. I know it almost by heart now.
</p>

<p>
I suggest that the Rubyers get their site up and running on a good domain -
ruby.iglu.org.il would be fine, and can be arranged (not by me) and something
like ruby-il.org will be preferable. (I'm not sure they would like a
ruby.org.il domain because they tend to be very costy and difficult to
manage.) Their site should be running as soon as possible even if it is lacking
something, so people will see a presenence. We all know that Perl 6 really took
off after Audrey Tang released a heavily incomplete, but still working
interpreter for it called Pugs, which allowed people to start playing with it.
The list of projects that had not been released until ready is long. But most
successful projects nowadays were deployed as incomplete and often
buggy versions, but enough to work with: the Linux kernel, Pugs, perl (perl 1
was absolute brain-damage), python, the GIMP, Vim, Emacs, etc.
</p>

<p>
The same applies to web-sites. How many sites have you seen with "This is
going to be the best site since sliced bread", and it amounted to nothing?
</p>

<hr />

<p>
I believe many "Web 2.0" social networks-based ideas are going to turn into
a disaster. A social network is not enough to guarantee success. One should
start with a good simple idea: sharing photos online - Flickr; finding
where your friends are located -
<a href="http://www.frappr.com/">Frappr.com</a>, etc. and then later on build
more and more social-networky things, if at all. But, for example, a site
based entirely on a social network with a small difference, is not going to
work. I have my share of social networks I know of, and there's a limit to
how much I can become involved and monitor them.
</p>

<p>
Live Journal is a social network, but I'm mostly here because it supplies
a great blog hosting, which beats having to feed and care for my own blog
on my domain. (I have enough trouble taking care of my static HTML site
and of <a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/wiki/">Eskimo</a> - thank you.) I'm
also using Flickr just to share my photos, or see other people's photos,
and not too much to socialise. If I were an investor, I would invest in an
idea that sounds good, or in very clueful people trying to create a better
wheel in a good way.
</p>

<p>
When discussing what we wanted from future meeting there were a few people
who gave "If X then a really bad Y will happen" forcast. They also talked a
lot about "we should do X" where X was very general and vague. It is known
that should statements like "I should be more careful" are very demotivating,
and can also cause a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression">clinical
depression</a>. The important thing is that Ruby meetings will be
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/41249.html">fun</a>, and even if
sometimes less people arrive than usual, make sure to persist them. All the
clubs I've been involved to had some lulls and we survived.
</p>

<p>
Finally, as I noted Ruby needs better online documentation. It has only one
decent book - the Pick-Axe book. And it goes into exhausting detail and is
very comprehensive. I gave up on reading it cover to cover. A "Quick and
Dirty Introduction to Ruby" for people already familiar with some or all of
Perl, Python, PHP, Scheme, Tcl, Smalltalk, etc. I believe this will be a more
beneficial project than yet another site. Plus, all the knowledge should
be concentrated in a few places rather than spread across half a gazillion
obscure blog entries, where Google is no help.

<h2>2007-04-13: The S.L.M./Sh.L.M Root in Semitic Languages</h2>

<p>
Some people believe that the Hebrew word "Shalom" (שלום) means "peace".
However this is not exactly the case. Some people also believe as a result that
Islam means "religion of peace", but this is also certainly not the case. This
is due to lack of understanding of the Semitic root S.L.M. or Sh.L.M.
</p>

<p>
In many Semitic languages there was a general duality between the "S" and
"Sh" sounds. In the Hebrew alphabet, the same letter - ש - is used for both
sounds. So S.L.M can also be Sh.L.M in some cases. In Semitic languages there's
a three-letter or four-letter root for verbs and other words, and there are
several ways to transform them.
</p>

<p>
Now the verb S.L.M. is a Semitic root that has a general meaning of
wholeness, fullness or completeness. In Hebrew, "Shalam" used to mean ended,
but it is no longer really used. "Nishlam" means "ended" as well, and its use
is more common, but a bit archaic. "Shilem" is paid for, "Shulam" is was paid
for.  "Hishtalem" (derived from "Hitshalem") is was worthwhile, or more
recently got an extra education. "Hishlim" is completed, and "Huslam" is "was
completed".
</p>

<p>
Now "Shalom" is essentially "well-being" - a state where nothing bad
happens.  In the political field, it means "peace", but in fact the early word
for such peace in Hebrew was "Sheqet" which means "quiet". <a
href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0703.htm">Judges 3 - "Wa'<b>tishqot</b>
ha'aretz Shmonim Shanah"</a> - "and the land was quiet for 80 years".
</p>

<p>
Shalom is not necessarily about peace between countries. For example one
can say "The United States government will do everything to ensure the
'Shalom' of the passengers of the kidnapped plane". And then there was
"Milhhemeth Shlom-Hagalil" ("מלחמת שלום-הגליל") which was the "war for the
Shalom [or well-being] of the Galilee".
</p>

<p>
Now about Islam - Islam is the noun form of the Arabic verb "Aslama", which
means converted to Islam. Aslama, being S.L.M. was meant to mean a
"Complete devotion to one's faith." Similarly "Muslim" (pronounced
"Mooss-leem")is someone who is an Islam practictioner. Peace or even well-being
have nothing to do with it.

<h2>2007-04-15: The Praise of Mysticism (or Neo-Tech in a nutshell) </h2>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus">Erasmus of Rotterdam</a> wrote
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Praise_of_Folly">The Praise of
Folly</a>, where he gave the case for making foolishness (i.e decisions by
intelligent people but very wrongheaded) an explanation for many problems.
Today, I'll go a step further, and give "The Praise of Mysticism", where I
claim that Mysticism - the irrational belief that mind-conjured realities
can take the place of the common, absolute reality, and the ultimate cause
of all evil - can often be used as the ultimate reason for many things.
</p>

<p>
People often look for natural motives: <b>money, power, etc.</b>. But in the
case of evil people (including most politicians, most clergymen, many people
in the media, etc.), there is another motive: mysticism or evil. They often
do things <b>because they are evil</b>, not because they seek money or
whatever. It may seem a bit presporous but carry on.
</p>

<h2>The Evil People</h2>

<p>
My mother once told me there are no evil people only evil actions. She
couldn't have been more wrong. Hitler was obviously evil. So was Stalin, Mao
and other people. The Nazis caused the death of over 20 million people in
World-War-II. The Communists in the 20th century killed <b>100 million of
their own people</b>. Why would anyone kill so many people? It wasn't for
survival - no. They were evil. Here's what
<a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/orientation/">the Neo-Tech orientation
and definition has to say about it</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The meaning of moral in Neo-Tech is simple and direct: Whatever is consciously
done to help fill human biological needs is good and moral (e.g., the
productive actions of honest people). Whatever is consciously done to harm or
prevent the filling of human biological needs is bad and immoral (e.g., the
destructive actions of mystics and neocheaters).
</p>

<p>
Honestly using one's reasoning nature is always beneficial and moral;
dishonestly using one's reasoning nature is always harmful and immoral.
...Volitionally harmful acts always arise from mysticism -- from dishonesty,
rationalizations, evasions, defaults.
</p>

<p>
Yet, acting on fully integrated honesty (Neo-Tech), not reason itself, is the
basic moral act. When Genghis Khan, for example, chose to use reasoning for a
specific military move, then in an out-of-context sense, he chose to act
morally by protecting himself and his troops (thus filling human biological
needs). But in the larger sense of fully integrated honesty, Khan's total
actions were grossly immoral in choosing to use aggressive force in becoming a
mass murderer (thus negating human biological needs). The highly destructive,
irrational immorality of Genghis Khan's overall dictatorial military actions
far outweighed any narrow, out-of-context "moral" actions. ...<b>Genghis Khan
was enormously evil</b> as were Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Castro, Pol Pot.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
OK, now if those people are so evil and destructive, what has made them able
to destroy so much? Why do people listen to them? The answer lies in
<b>Neocheating</b>. But first some historical background.
</p>

<h2>The Origins of Consciousness</h2>

<p>
A lot of people think that people once, while being fully conscious and
sentient, wondered about the origins of life, and created the gods. In "Guns,
Germs and Steel", Jared Diamond contemplates that religions and priests were
created to justify wars. However, this is not the case.
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time, all humans were completely unconscious: they were fully
capable of thinking, reasoning, and functioning, but were still automatons. They
had no sense of self, and had the dual-chamber (= "bicameral") mind to guide
them. They were super-intelligent and built complex societies, <b>invented
language, writing and trade</b>, but were still all <b>non-sentient</b>.
</p>

<p>
It may seem fantastic. However, bees are fully functioning - but are they
conscious? How about bacteria? Somewhere between a human being and a passive
animal you have to draw the line and that line goes in humans of around 1500
BC. They weren't conscious. <b>Very intelligent but not conscious</b>.
</p>

<p>
These people had <b>gods that guided them</b>. Originally the voices of dead
people and leaders, these gods became their guides. The leaders spoke to the
gods and were often considered gods, and so there was an hierarchy. However,
then societies became <b>too complex to be managed by unconsciousness
alone</b>. And due to the geography of the Near East, the people had no place
to spread to. Moreover, trade and other factors have weakend and proliferated
the voices of the gods. So without much choice, people had to create a new
layer of mental processes (a <b>brain "software"</b> if you may) -
<b>consciousness</b>.
</p>

<p>
People became conscious, but they still recalled the gods that guided them.
So they looked for ways to retrieve them. The people who could became known as
<b>"Nevi'im"</b> to the Israelis, as <b>"Oracles"</b> to the greeks, etc. They
are <b>modern day Schizophrenics</b>. They reverted to the original bicameral
mind and spoke in rhythms, because rhythm, poetry and song was the language of
the gods,  the language of the right hemisphere. Julian Jaynes gives a lot of
evidence to show that poetry is a right hemisphere function, while freeform
speech is a left hemisphere function.
</p>

<p>
However, people still have vestiges of the pre-conscious mind. They still
<b>often seek external authority</b> (even though they don't really need it)
and <b>many people seek to control others</b>. How do they achieve that?
</p>

<h2>The Paradigm for Controlling People</h2>

<p>
The tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is an early echo for the fact
that humans have <b>lost their "innocence" by becoming conscious</b>. People
still seek an effortless paradise. Thus, evil people make use of the following
paradigm as identified in
<a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/neotech/discovery/nt3.html">Neo-Tech III</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
First man is <b>made to feel guilty</b>. He is <b>condemned for having lost his
"innocence" by inventing consciousness</b>. He is condemned for assuming the
responsibility to use his own mind to guide his life. He is condemned for
exchanging his automatic, bicameral life for a volitional, conscious
life...condemned for exchanging his nature-given bicameral mind for a
superior, man-invented conscious mind.
</li>

<li>
Then man is <b>offered automatic solutions to problems</b> and guidance
through life
-- is offered an <b>"effortless" Garden of Eden</b> or a utopian hereafter if he
exchanges his own invented consciousness for faith in external "authority":
bicameral faith in some leader, doctrine, or god. He is offered the "reward" of
protection and the escape from the self-responsibility of making one's own
decisions to guide one's own life. But for that "reward", he must renounce his
own mind to follow someone else's mind or wishes disguised as "truths"
promulgated by some external "authority" or higher power.
</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<p>
Makes sense, doesn't it? Christianity used it during the middle ages, and so
did the Nazis, the Communists, and all theist religions and doctrines nowadays
do in various variations. You can hear leaders speaking it in the news all the
time.
</p>

<h2>Neocheating and Altruism</h2>

<p>
Neocheating is the technique of cheating people while appearing to be good,
honest and direct. It usually oriented around <b>"Altruism"</b> - the belief
that people should subject themselves to <b>"higher causes"</b> - anything
except their own happiness. The
<a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/neotech/advantages/">Neo-Tech advantages</a>
dispel a large number of falsehoods that accumulated throughout the
centuries. It also shows how words were contorted to mean different things,
and with a contorted language came contorted thinking, as <b>language is
primarily and most importantly a tool of thought</b>, not a tool of
communication. I highly recommend reading it cover to cover, or at least going
over some of the advantages there after reading the orientation and
definition.
</p>

<p>
Altruism is unnatural for humans. I'm not claiming that humans should not
contribute to others. I spend most of my waking hours contributing to the
well-being of everybody by working on public artwork. But I'm doing it
<b>by choice</b> and because it <b>makes me happier</b>. Everything people do
is in order to increase their self-esteem, either directly or indirectly. But
some people were led to believe they have to subject themselves to "higher
causes": "the poor", "the country", "God", "the family", "the religion",
etc. etc. But these causes are unnatural. They don't make you happier -
they make you feel more guilty, more dependent and less happy.
</p>

<p>
All the religions of the world (including many "secular" religions) are
<b>religions of death and are meant to control people</b>. They make them less
integrated thinkers, cloud their mind, subject them to "higher causes" and
improper care.
</p>

<h2>The Revolution has Started</h2>

<p>
The so-called "leaders" of the world are incompetent, impotent, dishonest,
deceitful, liars, dishounarable, cheaters - in short mystical and evil. They
are capable of doing anything that Tolkien ever depicted Sauron to do, but are
completely not awe-inspiring. After reading this summary, they will lose their
mind. Completely. And this message will spread like wildfire.
</p>

<p>
Tomorrow, the head guards of Nasarallah (a simple peon) will point their
machine guns at him and tell him to leave his well-guarded office or be shot
to death. He will leave, for he is too incompetent of losing his life. Tomorrow,
the President of the United States (who supposedly heads the U.S. government,
which is the most destructive entity in existence today) will be answered with
"Go to hell, Mr. Bush", or "Fuck you, idiot!" for every command he utters. And
every convention he goes to will immediately become a very loud booing and
cursing and people disrespecting him and shouting the worst possible and often
unprintable mess. He will end up crying, and having to quit.
</p>

<p>
I don't make the Neo-Tech <b>mistake of following the "Eye for an Eye</b>, Tooth
for a Tooth" revenge. <b>I believe in Justice - not in revenge.</b> All the evil
people (mystics and neocheaters) will become commoners and will eventually
be trained to become good honest people. They will become a tail for the lions
instead of the heads of the jackals. I'm not <b>interested in killing them</b>,
because killing a Hitler is still killing a conscious being, however his past
is. I would humiliate Hitler to tears, but would never harm a strand of his
hair.
</p>

<p>
This is true justice. I may be compassionate and an idealist, but it is better
than being a murderer.
</p>

<p>
If you're reading this message - join me now. Stop subjecting yourself to
the old and deprecated bicameral mind. Stop believing that your consciousness
can survive the absense of the body on which it depends. (A.k.a: the
afterlife). The future is a future of
<a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/neotech/advantages/advantage114.html">youth-rejuvanating
biological immortality</a> for everyone, not of death for every conscious
human being, whether a destructive mystic, a honest and happy factory worker
or a supreme value-producer. (It doesn't make a difference - none of them
should die).
</p>

<p>
Religion, doctrines dogma, prejudice and deceit bring you nothing but death.
Don't subject yourself to death. <a href="http://www.neo-tech.com/neotech/advantages/advantage98.html">Regain your Growth</a> and experience <b>more and
more happiness and joy</b>, more and more productivity, and less and less
dependence on other people. Your body may age, but not your soul, your spirit,
or your psyche. This way, you'll never want to die, and never find a need to.
</p>

<p>
The future is now!

<h2>2007-04-19: Music Recommendation: David Arkenstone</h2>

<p>
Two Croatian Messenger friends of mine referred me to
<a href="http://www.davidarkenstone.com/">David Arkenstone</a>. He's a
composer of New Age/Atmospheric music.
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/davidarkenstone">His MySpace page</a>
used to contain 4 samples, but I can no longer find them there. In any case,
I couldn't figure out a way to download them to my computer.
</p>

<p>
However, <a href="http://www.g2p.org/">G2P</a> can find his "Atlantis" CD.
I downloaded it using wget and can now listen to it. I like its final track:
"Below the Ocean: The Spirit of Atlantis" the best, but the other tracks are
very good too. I guess I'll have to buy it now.
</p>

<p>
Arkenstone seems like he's very talented, and creaed some great music, but
unfortunately he seems to be relatively unknown. Well, I hope this entry will
make him a bit more so.

<h2>2007-04-27: Common Fallacies No. 1: the Broken Window Fallacy</h2>

<p>
This is the first in a series of essays about common fallacy patterns in the
computer world. The first is what I call the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window">Broken Window Fallacy</a> of computers. As
you may know in the broken window fallacy, one says that if something is
damaged then it generates more revenue to the economy, because one will have
to fix the damage. However, as is demonstrated in the article, it might as
well been done differently.
</p>

<p>
I talked with a few people on IRC about how I hated the fact that most people
are still using Windows which is quickly getting infected with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">malware</a>, or
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/no-ie/">Internet Explorer</a>, which
is lagging behind Firefox and other browsers in its support for web standards,
and makes the job of the web designer much harder. So they told me that it is
actually a good thing because that way someone has to fight the malware (a
very uphill battle), and they have more work as web developers.
</p>

<p>
In a podcast Interview with him
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html">Joel Spolsky</a> said
that Open Source Software will reduce the demand for programmers, because they
make some tasks easier. And so programmers are happier, but they have to
work less. He missed the point that a lot of proprietary software also does
that, because it costs a fraction of the cost it would take to develop all
this functionality from scratch. But that's not the main thing that is wrong
in this argument.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that tech workers can never run out of things to do. In the
time they have to adapt their web-sites for MSIE, they can better spend on
things like having better functionality, more web-sites, more pages. The time
people spend making sure their Windows systems are free of malware, is better
spent happpily using Linux and getting some actual, productive work done.
</p>

<p>
So Windows and MSIE are a huge strain on society. I can never run out of
things to do. At the moment, I have an idea for a commercial site, several
essays I'm working on, tons of ideas for other essays, open source software
to write, and lots of external open-source projects that would love to have
me as a contributor. Trying to adapt my sites to broken proprietary software
only slows me down. It also slows you down if you're a developer.
</p>

<p>
So don't fall into the "broken window" fallacy. Encourage everyone around
you to switch away from MSIE and Windows.

<h2>2007-05-01: A World War II What If</h2>

<p>
Can you imagine how World War II would have been different if a subtantial
percentage of the citizens in the European countries were armed? And no,
they wouldn't have fought each other because they would have been afraid
of their other armed neighbours, and as a general rule the Europeans then
were peaceful.
</p>

<p>
I find it amazing how people think that gun-control makes one safer. To
quote the old adage: "If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.".
And it is one way to make sure the government has a monopoly on firearms,
and can abuse it against the defenseless citizens.

<h2>2007-05-05: First Day of my Thirties</h2>

<p>
I was born on 5 minutes past midnight on 5 May, 2007. Thus, I'm 30 today. I
spent the last day of my twenties relaxing. Among other activities, I went to
bike once in the morning and once in the afternoon. I took one of our cameras
for the second bike ride, and took some photos. Some of them came out pretty
well, but not all, and I'll upload them to Flickr soon.
</p>

<p>
Today my family is holding a certain informal party for me at home. I requested
an Arabic-to-Hebrew dictionary for my birthday, so I can regain my Written
Arabic. I was a bit depressed about turning 30, or at least thought I was, but
I'm still happy in general. As time goes by, I feel I become wiser and more
mature, but I could still appreciate staying young in body forever.
</p>

<p>
And I'm certainly going to make sure I'll stay young in spirit. For the
past thirty years, I remained hopeful, idealistic, enthusiastic, and
a Romanticist. While my opinions have changed, I feel that
I only became more idealistic and excited as time went by. You can too, whether
you're 18, 25, 30 or 80.
</p>

<p>
Happy 5 of May, everyone!

<h2>2007-05-12: Dispelling some Israeli Myths - draft</h2>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> this is a draft of a document I'm writing to help combat some
mis-conceptions people have on Israel. Please place your comments,
suggestions and ommisions' reports as comments. I'm planning to later on convert it to a page on
my site.
</p>

<h1>The document itself</h1>

<p>
There are many myths and mis-perceptions about Israel, that many people
(often Americans) think. This document aims to dispel some of them.
</p>

<h2>Israel is all Desert</h2>

<p>
While the southern part of Israel (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev">the Negev</a>) is a desert, most of the northern part has growth, and supports
a lot of trees, bushes, shrubs and fauna. There are <a href="http://www.israelimages.com/result2.asp?sql=%28Category%3D3+AND+Sub_cat%3D2%29&amp;keywords=&amp;cat=&amp;subcat=Flowers+%26+Plants&amp;r1=c2">many pictures</a>
over at the <a href="http://www.israelimages.com/">Israel Images site</a>
</p>

<p>
Most Israelis live in the northern part of Israel, which is quite lively.
</p>

<h2>Israel is Civilised</h2>

<p>
Israel is a civilised country. It has stone buildings, roads, cars, trains,
lower education and higher education, an industry, electricity and good
Internet connectivity, and an abundant food supply.
</p>

<h2>Not all Israeli Jews are Orthodox (Haredi)</h2>

<p>
Most Israeli Jews are not Haredi Jews who dress almost completely in black.
In fact a lot of them are secular Jews who mostly don't even wear a kippa,
or religious Jews who still lead a normal life. Religious Jews can be
distinguished by look by the fact that the males wear
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah">a Kippa</a>, and the females
dress in unfashionable dresses or skirts, instead of the usual pants or
more fashionable dresses that women wear.
</p>

<h2>Israel has More Serious Problems than Terrorism</h2>

<p>
While most of the Israeli-related news is about terrorist acts (or acts
of retaliation of the Israeli Defence Force against terrorist activity), Israel
is in fact a very peaceful and safe country. Here are several more serious
problems in Israel than terrorism:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
More Israelis were killed in road accidents, than all those killed in
terrorism and wars.
</li>

<li>
It has very high taxation (sometimes over 60% of the wage), many irrational
welfare laws, and a very poor middle class.
</li>

<li>
There are many irrational regulations.
</li>

<li>
There is a lot of theft, and other crimes.
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Most Jews don't Carry a Gun</h2>

<p>
Israeli soldiers (males and females) are required to carry a gun with them
during their service. However, Israelis who are not serving, are not required
to do that, and most of them do not make use of their gun-bearing rights
to carry a gun daily.
</p>

<h2>Israel has a High Life Expectency</h2>

<p>
Despite everything according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy">the Wikipedia, Israel has the 21st largest
life expectancy in the world.</a>
</p>

<h2>2007-05-22: New Israeli &quot;Big Brother&quot; Law for Blocking the Internet for Minors</h2>

<p>
There's a new Israeli law proposal for a law that wants to prevent minors from
accessing "questionable sites" on the Internet, and to require grown-ups to
identify themselves using biometric identifaction to allow their unrestricted
access to the Internet. This law faces objections from the Israeli Ministry of
Treasury and the Israeli
Ministry of Law, as well as the
<a href="http://www.isoc.org.il/">Israeli Internet Society</a>. This law should better be stopped sooner than later.

<h2>2007-06-03: Psyche Death / Growth Death</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030204175130/www.neo-tech.com/neotech/advantages/advantage98.html">"Psyche
Death" or "Growth Death"</a> (the Neo-Tech terms) means that a person
continues to live physically, but his mind is dying: he becomes more and more
cynical and less excited and enthusiastic about life; less and less happy;
becomes less and less proficient; and also is capable of feeling less and
less love (romantic or otherwise) and other positive emotions.
</p>

<p>
It often occurs even before the body has fully matured. In the Technion,
I've known someone who already had psyche death in his mid-twenties. On the
other hand, I've been corresponding with an 80 years-old programmer, who still
has a living psyche, and is otherwise very enthusiastic and excited about
life. (He's still affected by his old age and old legacy practices, but is
nonetheless still productive.)
</p>

<p>
So what are the implications of Psyche Death? Moshe Bar tells about it in
<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/06/07/1255227&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=156">this Slashdot
interview</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
I am studying law because at my age I already see how much faster younger
programmers are than me. Back when I was in my early twenties nobody could beat
me at programming. Nowadays, when I sit next to people like Andrea Arcangeli, I
realize that programming, too, (even considering the advantage of experience)
is for the young. Perhapes extreme programming, ie good quality, high speed
programming, should be considered a sport and not an art or science or a skill.
Since, I do not see myself being a programmer at 60 years (which is more than
years from now), I deduced that I have to find a new job between then and now.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, while it is possible that one write code more slowly when one is
younger, it does not mean that one should completely refrain from writing
code when one is older. Plus, lately I've spent a weekend working on
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/">Test-Run</a>, and
ended up with about 3,000 added or removed lines, which I felt really good
about. And moreover, even a former programmer can probably become a good
manager or a team leader, for a software company, but without good experience
in coding he probably won't be a good manager. And you don't need a law
diploma for that.
</p>

<p>
I know a programmer who just turned 50 who I'm almost certain has a
dying growth. He tends to be cynical, keeps finding (wrong-headed, IMO) faults
in good ideas I have, and often tends to get his priorities wrong. Last year,
he permanently and abruptly quit from helping with the organisation of
<a href="http://ap.hamakor.org.il/">August Penguin</a>, because he felt
that the movie that was prepared for the event, should have been subtitled
before it was released to the public, instead of after the fact by volunteers.
I tried to tell him that while accessibility for the disabled was important,
it was relatively orthogonal to promoting Open Source software in Israel
or elsewhere. Both causes were important, and having a feud (or "Brogez" in
Hebrew) because of a silly (3-minutes length) movie, that is just a
nice bonus, and not something integral to the conference.
</p>

<p>
It's very sad, and like I said, unnecessary. Now for a positive, non-Psyche
Death example: the programmer in his 80's. We've been co-operating on a
Freecell program he wrote, to which I wanted to integrate Freecell Solver.
We exchanged dozens of emails, and at one point even had a virtual
Instant-Messaging mode. It took us a lot of time to integrate FCS into his
program due to some of their incompatibilities, but we were successful. Since
then, he and I exchanged some bios, and then ended up discussing philosophy,
politics and religion. He seems very lively, excited, and enthusiastic, despite
his old age, and the fact he's already a grandfather.
</p>

<p>
He's been reading many books, which he has been ordering from Amazon.com. I
recommended he read <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#bicameral_mind">Julian
Jaynes' "Bicameral Mind" book</a> and he eventually did. ( He buys a lot of
books about history, or history science. )
</p>

<p>
Interacting with him, has been very inspiring for me. He admitted to me that
"his brain does not operate as fast as it used to", and I could tell his
programming practices are sub-optimal in today's standards. He's been around,
and old habits often die hard, and he is no longer really making a living off
programming.
</p>

<p>
So Psyche death is unnecessary. And psyche death is also not permanent - one
can easily reverse it by reading this entry and the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030204175130/www.neo-tech.com/neotech/advantages/advantage98.html">Neo-Tech original</a>. I'm not claiming Psyche Death
people are necessarily evil. While all evil people have Psyche death, most
people with a dying growth are still good people who are unnecessarily cynical
about life.
</p>

<p>
I told my 50 years-old friend several times that he should really read the
Neo-Tech article, and he told me that he did not have the time for that (even
though it's not very long). And to quote Q2 from
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">"We,
the Living Dead"</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Busy people are unproductive. We are very productive and so we're never busy.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Being too busy is another indication that you do not have a fully growing
psyche. Gandhi said <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/advice-for-the-young/#live_and_learn">"Live as if you were going to die
tomorrow. Learn as if you were going to live forever."</a>. However, it seems
too many people mis-understand this quote. From what I know of Gandhi, he was
almost never too busy.

<h2>2007-06-07: Media Recommendation</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matisyahu">Matisyahu</a> is a very cool
Jewish Reggae artist, with a Yiddish/Hassidic theme. Especially recommended is
his "King without a Crown" song. Wikipedia has a lot of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matisyahu">information about him</a>.
</p>

<p>
I recently watched the end of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Away_Home">"Fly Away Home"</a>, which
is a fictional film, but loosely based on real-life experiments by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Lishman">Bill Lishman</a>. The
photoggraphy was breath-taking, and I almost cried from excitement. I didn't
watch the start yet, but what I saw was very nice.
</p>

<p>
Finally there's <a href="http://www.websurdity.com/2007/02/28/uncomfortable-questions-was-the-death-star-attack-an-inside-job/">this
conspiracy theory based in the "Star Wars" world</a> (freely available online),
that I found extremely funny.

<h2>2007-06-21: Park Hayarkon Highlights</h2>

<p>
A while ago, when I biked in Park Hayarkon, and stopped as I usuallly do next
to the bridge, I saw a young mother sitting on the grass with her baby. The
mother took off her shoes and she was playing with the baby. The sight was so
idyllic that I wished I had had my camera there.
</p>

<p>
Once as I went out from the Park into Hayim Levanon St. and stood at the
junction of Rokahh and Haifa Road, I witnessed a motor-cyclist get injured
after moving into a large concrete mixer truck. The truck stopped close by,
and we helped the biker move into the sidewalk, and someone called an
ambulance using his cell-phone. I ended up delaying there for a while to
make sure everything was OK, and helped move the motorcycle into a useful
place.
</p>

<p>
After the ambulance came, the ambulance people said the motor cyclist
will probably be OK. I went to the policeman, and told him I saw the biker
get thrown away by the hit, but not the moment of the hit itself. So he
said it was still not good enough as an evidence.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, I recall having often seen an attractive jogger in the Park, and
while having not seen her in a while, recently saw another one who seemed very
similar to her. I still don't know if they are the same girl. Once when I
went out to the Park relatively early, I saw the mother who keeps jogging with
her baby's cart. It took me some time to recognise her because she was wearing
a different top.
</p>

<p>
I also saw some police horses standing by at a day when there was a festival
of some sort in the Park. They were very nice horses as horses go, and very
tamed.

<h2>2007-08-25: Neck Ache</h2>

<p>
On Monday's evening (IIRC), I got a neck ache. When I woke up it was very
much severed. It lasted for a few days until Wednesday, when it became better.
On Thursday, I went jogging, went to sleep, and when I woke up it worsened
again. On Friday, I started doing some exercises to relieve the pain, and it
seems to help a little. Now the ache is more under control, and I hope my
condition will improve in the upcoming days.
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough, I think the pain has relocated to a different place
in my back and neck.
</p>

</div>


<div class="entry">

<h2>2007-09-07: Bicycle-Lock Musing</h2>

<p>
My neck ache got much better, in case you were wondering. Yesterday, I went
to the bicycle room to check the air on my bike's wheels. (I believed they
had a flat tire, but it turned out not to be the case.) While I was there
I noticed something interesting about the lock I'm using to protect the bike.
</p>

<p>
The lock is basically a loop with a pin at one end, and a shaft with 4
rotating digits at the other end. Now, you can only insert the pin to the
shaft when the combination is right. However as I noticed, if the loop is open,
then the pin can be partially inserted when the digits towards the edge of the
shaft are right. Therefore, an attacker, can rotate the outermost digit until
the pin is partially inserted and find the rest of the digits in a similar way,
and that way discover what the combination is.
</p>

<p>
This reminded me of what Feynman told in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393316041/ref=nosim/shlomifishhom-20/">"Surely
you're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"</a> about the safes in the Los Alamos facility. He
discovered that one could determine the code of one type of safes, when they
were open, and so suggested that they are kept closed all the time. So I guess
that with such chains, they should also be kept tied at all time.

Another response by the same producer is

<h2>2007-09-23: Yom Kippur Summary</h2>

<p>
As has been the tradition for several years now, on Yom Kippur I've gone
over my weblogs' entries since last Yom Kippur and today I'll write a summary
of them.
</p>

<p>
Well, I've continued to write open-source code this year, mainly
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN modules</a>, but also
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/3294.html">this kernel
patch</a>. I also isolated and reported a few bugs and prepared some source
RPMs. A lot of my work was on
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/">Test-Run</a>, which
I'm no longer sure is the right approach, and that perhaps I'll need to work
on direct enhancements for TAP::Parser and TAP::Harness instead.
</p>

<p>
I've started publishing a series of Vim tips on my blog, and span off
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/">a technical blog</a>
to concentrate the Technical articles there.
</p>

<p>
I worked in one job this year, starting in January, and ending in March,
when I got fired. Getting fired from there has proved to be the worst event
of the year for me, but I got over it eventually. Close to that
were some discussions on use.perl.org and on Perl mailing lists
that I started.
</p>

<p>
This year I worked a lot on the Perl XML::RSS module and also successfully
completed a Perl Foundation grant for cleaning it up. I also received another
grant for working on a Perl-based MediaWiki parser, but I've seem to have
little motivation to work on it since I've received it (part of my general
lethargy lately), and it seems to me to be more difficult to get right
than I first expected it to be, and less interesting. I still have some working
code in the repository, but I don't feel very motivated to work on it.
</p>

<p>
I noticed that the amount of blogging, and activity in general
has considerably slowed down since March. I hope to regain my interest
in blogging and FOSS hacking, but I don't want to feel too bad about being
somewhat lethargic now.
</p>

<p>
In any case, that's it for this summary. Happy
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot">Sukkoth</a>, everyone, and
enjoy the new Jewish Year.

<h2>2007-09-29: Mathematical Riddle</h2>

<p>
Here's a mathematical riddle that I was told on IRC (and was able to solve,
after receiving a hint): find, without the aid of a computer, three natural
numbers - x, y and z - so that x^2 + y^3 = z^5 (where "^" is power).

<h2>2007-10-02: What I Hate about GMail</h2>

<p>
Many people converted to use <a href="http://gmail.com/">GMail</a>
as their primary mail client. I, however, having been used to
<a href="http://kontact.kde.org/kmail/">KMail</a> have found many GMail
shortcomings. As a result, I'm still using KMail as my primary email
client and try to avoid GMail as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
Here is what I find problematic in GMail:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
It doesn't work properly in <a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a>.
I have to use Firefox to use it.
</li>

<li>
It doesn't have a way to filter based on mailing list headers (such as
"List-Id", "List-Post", etc.). Thus, often when mail is sent from a mailing
list, it still arrives at the inbox.
</li>

<li>
It's very hard to follow threads there. They are all on one page.
</li>

<li>
The labels list (which double serve as folders) is flat and not a tree.
</li>

<li>
It doesn't have KMail's Right-click-on-an-email-address+"Reply to..." feature,
which is very safe and convenient.
</li>

<li>
Furthermore, when the "Reply-To:" header is set, both "Reply" and
"Reply-to-all" do the same thing.
</li>

<li>
GMail has no "Send Again" feature to re-send a message that was already sent.
</li>

<li>
There is no way to label or delete individual messages - only entire threads.
As such, if you purge a mailing list archive you also lose all the mail you
sent there.
</li>

<li>
Changing the subject line of a replied-to message starts a new thread, not only
in the user's GMail account, but for every recipient of the message.
</li>

<li>
The GMail editor has a tendency not to put the quoting symbols
("<tt>&gt;</tt>") in the first line of a block.
</li>

<li>
GMail disables the forward button in Mozilla. So if you press "Back" you
cannot press forward again to go back there.
</li>

<li>
GMail has no option to avoid adding the dash-dash-space prefix to the
signature. It adds it automatically, without asking. Granted - it can be
deleted, and KMail has the same problem too, even for signatures generated
by a command line.
</li>

<li>
There is no way to select all the unread messages in a label, or all the unread
messages across labels.
</li>

<li>
There is no indication that an email that was sent actually arrived at a
mailing list (to which one is subscribed) after it arrived there.

<p>
GMail is not all bad. The search is very fast, which is a joy. But I still
much prefer KMail, and refrain from using GMail as much as I can. Perhaps
Google can fix most of these problems if they are motivated enough to do so,
but from my general impression with the gmail.com QA, they don't seem to care
at all.

<h2>2007-10-27: Response to Dotan Kamber's &quot;Making a Copyrights-Protected Work Public is a Violation&quot; Post</h2>

<p>
I'm subscribed to <a href="http://dok2.blogli.co.il/">Dotan Kamber's blog at
blogli</a>, where he usually blogs in Hebrew about
<a href="http://www.mandriva.com/">Mandriva</a> and other Linux-related
topics, so it's interesting, at least to me.
</p>

<p>
This time, I'd like to comment on
<a href="http://dok2.blogli.co.il/archives/134">one of the exceptional
entries there</a> that deal with the topic of
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/">file
swapping</a> in light of
<a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/04/2232211">recent
news</a>. I'll translate the entry here, and comment on it.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Making a Work whose Distribution is Limited by Copyrights Public is a
Violation [of the Law]!
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, obviously according to the present bylaws, it is a violation. That's
stating the obvious. However, that's not the main question. The real question
is whether it is ethical, moral and whether the law should be changed to
accomodate for this. The law is not always right.
</p>

<p>
During the Prohibition of Alcohol, drinking Alocohol in the United States
was illegal. Did it made drinking or selling alcohol any more wrong than it
actually is? At the moment, drugs are illegal,
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/drug-legalisation/">but
the law is the problem not the fact that people violate it.</a> During the
Nazi regime of Europe, it was illegal to give refuge to Jews, but it still
didn't make it any less of a highly moral act.
</p>

<p>
So, I would argue that Dotan's statement is not indicative of the Morality
of that action, and whether the law is right or wrong.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The American Jury has decided according to the spirit of the law, instead of
the revolutionary spirits that various organisations are trying to spread,
and accused Jammie Thomas in violation of Copyrights.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, this is in a way stating the obvious. Well, Dotan is trying to imply
that because the opinion that file sharing should be legal is a
"revolutionary spirit" it is inferior to "the spirit of the law". Well, wasn't
the equality of rights for women once the domain of such
"revolutionary spirits"? Wasn't it the case for democracy in general? Isn't
liberalism in Communist China now the domain of "revolutionary spirits"? Isn't
it the case for drug legalisation now?
</p>

<p>
So it doesn't necessarily mean it's inferior. The law can be wrong
and often is.
</p>

<p>
And who are these organisations? For once, many of them are individuals - about
20% of Americans use file-sharing programs. Secondly, they include the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, without its
software Dotan would not be able to compose his post, post it on the Web, or
publish it on his blog, as they are all based on the software of the
FSF.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Jammie was sentenced to pay the copyrights owners damages of $9,250 for
each of the 24 works (total of $220,000), which she legally purchased,
and made available for download using the KaZaa file-sharing program.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, I don't suppose you think that damages of $220,000 dollars are a bit
outrageous here? And don't you think extorting such an amount of money from
a single-parent mother to be given to companies whose budget is tens of
milliards of dollars per year (in a kind-of "take from the poor and give
to the rich" scheme), a bit pointless?
</p>

<p>
Is $220,000 realistic? As <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=318461&amp;cid=20861333">mrwonton mentions here</a>
compared to the prices of songs on iTunes, it would mean she would have had to
share nearly half a terabyte to be guilty of such damages.
</p>

<p>
So it's really all outrageous.
</p>

<p>
Here are some other links regarding the case:

And I should point you to my piece
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/">"The

swapping is not bad, and why it should be legal. Dotan has yet to properly
address all the arguments that I've given in its third edition.

<h2>2007-10-27: Live Journal Tip: Turning off the Snap Previews for Links</h2>

<p>
I've always been annoyed by Snap.com Previews for links in blogs, where one
sees an annoying preview window of the link when hovering with the mouse
cursor over an external link. Today I discovered that they were now present
in my journal here on LJ, so I sought a way to remove them. It wasn't too hard.
</p>

<p>
In order to cancel them one should go to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/manage/settings/">the viewing options</a> (while logged in, of course), and
uncheck the "Graphic previews" checkbox ("Enable graphic previews on external
links within your journal"). Then your journal will be free of them.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for Live Journal for making this feature optional.
</p>

I haven't played any "World of WarCraft".

<p>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFTlhxwwkKE">A nice song by

<h2>2007-11-30: Politics: Canadian DMCA Law + Saddam Hussein's Support of Terror</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/11/29/1523217">Slashdot Reports that there's a very bad DMCA-like Candian Copyright Act brewing</a>. Michael
Geist <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/1447/273/">has 30
things that Canadian can do to stop it</a>.
</p>

<p>
That put aside, I'd like to quote something that a U.S. Soldier who had
been serving in Iraq told us about Saddam Hussein's support of terrorish
activity, which has changed a mistaken perception of mine:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Me:</b> Yes, but Bush claimed that he needed to attack Iraq because it
supported terrorism, which wasn't really true. Iraq was not a threat to
worldwide well-being. As opposed to say, Iran.
</p>

<p>
<b>Soldier:</b> Shlomi, actually that's not true... i'm not a huge fan of bush
either, but i will say that i have personally been involved in well over 5
dozen raids that involved terrorist training camps in major iraqi cities.
</p>

<p>
<b>Me:</b> I see. I believe you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Soldier:</b> Shlomi, the thing about Iraq is this, it was being used as
staging ground for Iran and Syria terrorist units, also... a special unit was
trained here called the Al Kud, that was specifically trained to attack
Israel.
</p>

<p>
<b>Someone else:</b> Yeah, but did those terrist camps exist *before* the
invasion?
</p>

<p>
<b>Soldier:</b> Someone else, yes they did. Someone else, there are few if
any terrorist camps in Iraq at this time. Most are trained outside of Iraq.
In fact the majority (and i say 90%) of all terrorist activity here in Iraq is
from outside nations, not local Iraqi nationals.

<h2>2007-12-01: I Biked Today</h2>

<p>
I went out biking today, after not biking for a long time. The weather was
nice, and I was able to were "training" clothes for most of the ride. At the
beginning of the ride, I took a break and pushed the bike by foot. It's been
a while since I needed to, which may indicate that I'm out of shape.
</p>

<p>
I saw many people in the park, including some good-looking girls. After the
park, near the "Ha'aretz" Museum, I felt that my head, and upper body were
on fire, so I took off my sweatshirt, and rode the rest of the cycle with
only my T-shirt.
</p>

<p>
It feels good to having biked, and I now feel calmer and more focused.
I should do it more often.

<h2>2007-12-04: Media Recommendations</h2>

<p>
I have a lot of individual media recommendations (mainly YouTube videos)
in my queue, clogging my bookmarks menu. Thus, while I'm waiting for kernel
2.6.24-rc4 to compile, I'd like to start putting them here. If I feel this
entry's too long, there may be some more with more recommendations
shortly. I'll see.
</p>

<p>
I found a lovely <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILAn6gqpRkE">set
of screencasts from Final Fantasy X arranged to the music of "Paradisio,
Bailando"</a>. It's much better and much less disturbing than what
seems to be the original video-clip of the song.
</p>

<p>
Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naWqkBb63P0">Anime
video clip of The Frey - In Over my head (Cable Car)</a>. Nice song and
nice animation that goes with it.
</p>

<p>
It's kind-of-lame, but I still liked <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GkCgh-Bbo8">this video of GreenTeaGirlie dancing to the Lucky Star by
Karma Club</a>. There's a <a href="http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-greentea5may05,0,7274870.story">strange story behind
GreenTeaGirlie</a>, but I liked the video and the music irrespectively of
it.
</p>

<p>
I can also recommend
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcAlA4iY_kY">new single of the
Spice Girls called "Headlines"</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there's
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0rY3dn5kos">Babysitting Blues
from the movie "Adventures in Babysitting"</a>. That was the best part of the
film, and I found it as good as I remembered it. "Nobody leaves this place
without singing the Blues!"
</p>

<p>
That's it for now. Now I got to reboot to the new kernel. I still
have more recommendations in queue, and I'll enumerate them later.

light-coloured top of the photo at the bottom of the screen, which interferes
with my transparent taskbar's minimised tasks.

<h2>2008-01-04: Tip: Dedicated Last.fm Client</h2>

<!-- Tags: tip, last.fm, amarok, music, play, songs, linux, client-->
<p>
<a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> is a music service that learns
what you like and plays appropriate songs and lets you choose songs based
on taxonomy. I used to listen to it using the KDE
<a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok player</a> which is otherwise
excellent, but its Last.fm playback is often buggy.
</p>

<p>
A few days ago I decided to see if there's a better client out there,
so I searched for "Last.fm Linux client" and ended up at
<a href="http://www.last.fm/download/?showplatform=Linux">this page for the
official Last.fm client for Linux</a>. It's open-source and free of
malware, and works much better than Amarok. I installed it on Mandriva using
the "urpmi lastfm-player" command, and there are probably packages for other
distributions.
</p>

<p>
There are similar clients for Windows and Mac OS X. This client works much
better than Amarok and I find Last.fm much more enjoyable now. But I guess
I'll now have to debug the Last.fm support of Amarok on my machine to see
where things go awry.
</p>

<p>
Happy listening!

<p>
I started working on Sunday, a week and a day ago. It's a (paid) one month
trial so both sides can see if they are happy with the arrangement. I'm working
as a Linux C++ server programmer for
<a href="http://www.emblaze.com/">Emblaze</a>. So far I'm mostly happy
with the job.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday I met with <lj user="peachuk" /> and
<a href="http://www.zak.co.il/tddpirate/">TDDPirate</a> on the University
Café close to my home. Peach has been visiting Israel and wanted to meet us
(we met online on IRC and MSN Messenger), and we decided to arrange a meeting.
Since TDDPirate is deaf, I brought a laptop from home to facilitate
communication with him, but I couldn't turn it on after we met. As it
evidently turned out, its battery was dead. (I was worried that my back will
hurt from carrying it, but thankfully it still doesn't.). So we had to do with
a pad of paper.
</p>

<p>
We ate dinner there and had a nice conversation. Peach seemed different in
real life, than her Instant Messaging persona, and I was happy to meet
TDDPirate again.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday was an eventful day. In the morning, I was dismayed to discover
that my cellphone had a low battery, because it wasn't charged properly. Then
at lunch, I accidently ate some
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicia_faba">fava beans</a> at lunch,
which I might be allergic to due to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency">G6PD</a>. So far, I'm OK, though.
</p>

<p>
Then I left work early to go to a <a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/">Tel Aviv
Linux Club</a> meeting. When I arrived at the final bus station, I noticed that
I could not feel my watch. As I discovered, its chain broke, but I still have
both pieces at home. I attended the talk which was about open-source Geographic
Information Systems, and included many nifty and visual presentations.
</p>

<p>
That's it for real life. Otherwise, the Mandriva Cooker Linux distribution
at home, recently upgraded <a href="http://www.perl.org/">perl</a> to version
5.10.0, which caused many software packages there to become broken because
they relied on it being the previous version (5.8.8). I had to fix some
of the problems on my system myself, while submitting or reporting
them to the distributor for inclusion. At work I'm now using Ubuntu Gutsy,
which has <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/">its own share of bugs</a>
that are almost, but not quite, entirely unlike the Mandriva ones.
</p>

<p>
One of the things that got broken was <a href="http://thewml.org/">Website
Meta Language</a>, which is an HTML preprocessor I'm using for all my sites.
I've hacked a quick patch to build it, but since now the GNU Autotools setup
for it has also become broken, I've decided to ditch them in favour of
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>. So far, CMake seems nice, but
I only really started with the conversion process.

<h2>2008-03-19: Rave about FIBI's Firefox Support</h2>

<!--Tags: bank, banks, fibi, firefox, monetary, money, real life, web sites, web standards, firefox, compatibility, linux, israel -->
<p>
I
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/24848.html">reported earlier</a>
that I switched to <a href="http://www.fibi.co.il/">the First International
Bank of Israel (FIBI)</a> because its site was designed and maintained with
cross-browser compatibility in mind. Recently, I tested it by doing two
monetary operations using the web-interface and using
<a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">the Firefox browser</a> on Linux. The
first one was a money transfer to pay for
<a href="http://act.perl.org.il/ilpw2007/">the Israeli Perl Workshop</a>. The
second was transferring funds into savings.
</p>

<p>
I'm happy to say that they I was able to perform both smoothly and without a
hitch. (I received a request for confirmation about the money transfer to my
cellphone, but wasn't particularly bothered with it.) so I'd like to thank
FIBI for maintaing such good web service and for being conscious with it,
and would like to note that I'm happy I made the switch. The web service has
saved me two trips to the bank branch during work hours, and will probably
save more like that in the future.
</p>

<p>
I hope other web service providers will consider adopting
cross-browser compatibility of their sites, and adherence to web-standards
and to portable behaviour. Firefox has excellent web-development tools,
and is much less buggy than Internet Explorer, and adding support to it should
not be too hard with help from web resources and from web development forums.

fine), to the Ra'anana Industrial Zone on weekdays? Any pointers would be
appreciated. Please contact me on <a href="mailto:shlomif@iglu.org.il">my

<h2>2008-04-18: Boring Personal Update</h2>

<!-- Tags: personal, update, log, work, passover, cmake, stress, hypomania, biking, perl begin, rethinking cpan, cmake, website meta language, wml, essays-->
<p>
First of all happy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover">Passover</a>
everyone! This year I'm getting this Sunday off, but not the rest of week
(though some of my co-workers have taken a leave of absence).
</p>

<p>
I've been a bit stressed lately, probably due to work issue, but I think I'm
happier and more focused now, and feel better. I went to bike today and
took my usual To-Park-Hayarkon-and-Back route. It was not too hot and not
too cold, and I enjoyed my ride, although felt I kinda drifted away in my
thoughts, and didn't pay a lot of attention to my surroundings.
</p>

<p>
For a tech update: I've continuted to work on my homesite, on
<a href="http://perl-begin.org/">Perl Begin</a> and on other projects,
such as
<a href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/04/rethinking-the-interface-to-cpan.html">the
Rethinking-CPAN effort</a>. I was also able to overcome some GNU Autohell
problems in Website Meta Language, in order to get some pending patches applied
there. This is a temporary solution until I finish working on the more robust
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>-based configuration system, which
would take a lot of time. I wasn't able to upload the archive yet, due to
connectivity problems and some Berlios.de bugs, but I hope to resolve them
soon enough.
</p>

<p>
I have several ideas for essays or mini-essays I'd like to work on - mostly
technical. And I accumulated a backlog of 415 (now 387) entries
on my web feed aggregator.
</p>

<p>
In any case, I hope you all are doing well. I have a few blog entries in the
queue, and if all goes well, I'll post them soon. Bye!

<h2>"Free" and "Freedom" in Hebrew (and English)</h2>

<!-- Tags: free, freedom, hebrew, etymology, linguistics, moment of hebrew, hhofesh, hofesh, herouth, hherouth, philology, english
-->

<p>
By inspiration from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover">Passover</a>, which
celebrates the end of the Egyptian Jewish slavery, and by some inspiration
from <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fisl2005.html">what David A.
Wheeler wrote about the meanings of free in English</a>, I present to you
some non-professional philological study of the meanings
of "Free" and "Freedom" in Hebrew and English.
</p>

<p>
First of all, there are two ways to say "freedom" in Hebrew: "Hhofesh" (חופש)
and "Hherouth" (חרות). The double-h is my way of indicating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heth">"Hheth"</a>, which is similar
to the "kh" in "Khan" or the Spanish "j", but even more throaty when pronounced
correctly.
</p>

<p> Now, "Hhofesh" means Freedom, while "Hherouth" is even stronger, and means
something closer to "liberty" in English, but probably not exactly the same. A
free person (or a thing) is "Hhofshi" (in Singular Masculine form, other forms
differ slightly), while I didn't hear the word "Herouthi" used often. Instead
one can say that someone is a "Ben-Horin" (i.e: "son [or belongs to a people
of] of free people."), which is probably the etymology for <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur">"Ben-Hur"</a>.
</p>

<p>
While "Herouth" is mostly limited to the liberty of a people or
inidividuals, and is considered high language, "Hhofshi" is more disputed. It
can naturally mean "libre" or free-from-oppression. But "Hhofesh" or "Hhufshah"
also means vacation in Hebrew (like "Hahhofesh hagadol" (the big "Hhofseh") -
which is the Hebrew name for the Summer vacation.) And so Hhofshi is sometimes
applied to a person who is relieved of work, education or other
responsibilities (such as that of a spouse), even though it is understood that
it is not an exact meaning.
</p>

<p>
More recently, "Hhofshi" also started to be applied to "gratis", "costless" or
"on-the-house" commodities similar to the "free-as-in-free-beer" distinction.
For example, in Falafel stands, one often hears that the extras are "Hhufshi"
meaning one can take as much as they want to put in his Pitah-bread. This may
have been an influence from English, but as I noted, "Hhofesh" in Hebrew has
not been restricted to mean freedom from oppression ("free-as-in-free-speech")
either.
</p>

<p>
One doesn't often hear people using "Hhofshi" for "lacking" as in "Caffeine-free", although
that may also have become a bit more common lately. "Caffeine-free" is
"Netol-caffeine" ("נטול-קפאין") in Hebrew, and one can also say "lelo kaffeine"
("ללא קפאין" without Caffeine) or "She'eyn bo kaffeine" ("שאין בו קפאין" "which
doesn't have Caffeine" more or else) in certain contexts.
</p>

<p>
And I'd also like to stress the fact that "free" in English even in its more
"libre" meaning, can be used either for freedom-from-oppression or
freedom-from-responsibilities.  If you value liberalism, you should try to use
it only in the freedom-from-oppression sense.  </p>

<p>
Happy Passover (a.k.a the Festival of Liberty in Hebrew) everyone!

<h2>2008-04-28: Unattainable Goals that are Still Worth Pursuing</h2>

<!-- Tags: goals, unattainable, pursuing, perfection, perfect, bible, objectivity, objectivism, thought, philosophy, essay-->
<p>
One thought that occurred to me lately was the fact that there are some goals in
life that can never be fully attained, but are nevertheless worth pursuing and
getting nearer and nearer to them. Like an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotically">asymptotic function</a> in mathematics if you may.
</p>

<p>
One example that I thought for it is the case of objectivity. Human beings are
subjective by nature and so can never be completely objective. However,
it doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to be as objective as possible, or
completely give up on being objective. (And by being objective I don't mean
having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">a
neutral Point-of-View</a>). Other people can disagree with me that objectivity
is a virtue but it's besides the point.
</p>

<p>
Now a co-worker of mine is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism">Hasidic Jew</a>,
and when I told him that I'm
an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Objectivist</a>,
he said that one cannot be completely Objective. He then gave the fact that the
Bible says that God brought the great drought because
<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0108.htm">"Yetzer Lev ha'adam
Ra' Mine'urav"</a> (= the desire of the Human's heart is bad from his
youth.), and later on decided not to do it again for
a similar reason. He brought that as an indication that the Bible
indicated that a man is not Objective by nature.
</p>

<p>
I thought about it for a moment and understood that the same can be said
about honesty (or "righteousness" in a more religious language). We can never
be completely honest and never lie or do the right thing everytime. But that
doesn't mean we shouldn't constantly try to be as honest as possible, or
worse succumb to complete dishonesty.
</p>

<p>
(I was told Immanuel Kant said something along the lines that if one
wished, for example, to be sincere, he must not lie even if threatened
by death. However, this is silly, because ethical and moral ideals are supposed
to help you lead a happier life (as identified by Aristotle in
the first book of
<a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html">"Nicomachean
Ethics"</a>), not to terminate them
prematurely under someone who employs force or threat of force against you,
when you otherwise did not do anything wrong.)
</p>

<p>
After I told it to my co-worker in an MSN Messenger conversation he agreed
with me that I was right on both the honesty aspect and, in accordance with
the principle, also the Objectivity one.
</p>

<p>
This concept can be applied to many other values or capabilities
we desire. For example, one can always improve as a programmer, which is
evident by the fact that most good programmers who take a look at their
old code are unhappy with it. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't try to always
improve as programmers.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, if a particular computing technology is large (e.g: Perl, Java, PHP,
.NET) and also has possibly spanned a large number of halo technologies (e.g:
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>,
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Apache Jakarta</a>, etc.), then mastering
the core language would be hard, and time consuming. In the Perl world we
constantly say that "no one knows all of Perl, not even Larry Wall". But it
doesn't mean you shouldn't do your best to master as much as you can out
of it, or need to.
</p>

<p>
One example that I'm especially sensitive about is politics in a software
project (possibly an open-source one ). Obviously, there can never be zero
politics, but the project leaders and members should always try to reduce its
amount, because not keeping it at bay is a recipe for disaster. I constantly
hear about important features that are not implemented or even bugs that are
left unfixed in open-source projects due to political reasons.
</p>

<p>
I can give <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> and to a
lesser extent the perl5-core development tools as good examples of projects
with very little politics and a value-maximising attitude.
</p>

<p>
One can think of many other examples.
</p>

<p>
My point is that while it is true that we are humans and can never be perfect,
we should always aim for perfection in some aspects. And given enough
willingness and by learning from our mistakes, we can remain close to
perfection in those respects all the time.
</p>

<h2>2008-05-01: What Motivates People and How?</h2>

<!-- Tags: philosophy, nazism, nazi, holocaust, neo-tech, objectivism, ayn rand, aristotle, communism, mysticism, thought of the day, happiness, self-esteem
-->

<p>
I feel obliged to write a special entry for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah">the Israeli Holocaust
Remembrance Day</a> which is today, so hopefully this will serve as such.
It's probably not going to be what you expect.
</p>

<p>
My first question is the one in the title: what motivates people? Why do
people do what they do? One of the most common myths about it is what I
call "pseudo-Darvinism" - the belief that people ultimately do everything
to have sex, or even to procreate. This was started by Sigmund Freud, and
also popularised by the book
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">The
Selfish Gene</a> (which I haven't read but seems very interesting). However,
this makes many explanations for human behaviour very contrived ("You chat
on instant messaging because you hope that one of the people in the
conversation will give you a lead for a date with an attractive
woman/man...") which don't make much sense. It also fails to explain why
many people and even many mammals who were castarated or otherwise
incapable of bringing offspring do not commit suicide. And also why many
people marry and lead happy lives, but don't want to have children. (And
sometimes also have abortions.) Or why some people become monks or nuns,
etc. or other clergymen who are forbidden from having sex. And arguably,
many people who have been virgins for a long time, or have wonderful
significant-others (and sex partners) whom they'll never wish to hurt, are
still chatting on the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and other IM services.
</p>

<p>
So it's not very satisfying. But there's a simpler explanation, and it
actually heavily predates Darvin. In the first book of
<a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html">Nicomachean
Ethics</a> Aristotle claims that we perform certain actions for certain
ends and that these ends are also sometimes means to an end. But there must
be an ultimate end, because otherwise everything will be meaningless.
</p>

<p>
He then claims that "happiness" is the ultimate ends for most humans.
Happiness can also be interpreted, or subtituted for "self-esteem", "pleasure",
"joy", etc. depending on how you see it.
</p>

<p>
So what does it mean? We do what makes us feel good about ourselves. However,
different people, and people at different times, have different actions that
they deem as making them happier. This is often perfectly natural. I can sit
at the computer most of the time and just write, chat, code software, etc.
Other people don't seem to like it enough to do it all the time. Often,
what makes us happy or our tastes is not a moral decision but an ammoral one
(i.e: something that's neither moral nor immoral.).
</p>

<p>
As software developers, our job is to make sure people encounter as few
frustrations as they can with our software. This means that the software
will have good usability, that it will "just work", that it won't have bugs,
and that if such problems are encountered they can easily be reported and
dealt with.
</p>

<p>
If a software works according to our expectations, and does what we want -
we'll feel happy. If it is too difficult to operate, lacks necessary features,
has obscure and unhelpful documentation, or doesn't behave acccording
to our expectations - we'll feel unhappy and helpless. As an example, I was
searching <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> for an IMAP module so
I can get a list of all the <tt>From:</tt> addresses in my work's inbox.
The first hits seemed overly complicated and required too much research.
Then I found
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Email-Folder-IMAP/">Email-Folder-IMAP</a>
whose synopsis had done something very similar to what I wanted. After
pasting the code, changing it a bit and running it, I had got a list of
all the from addresses. That has made me happy, and I was determined to use
Email-Folder-IMAP from then on.
</p>

<p>
Back to the main subject - the main problem in the world is that some people
derive pleasure from causing damage. For example, Genghis Khan has killed
millions of people in his irrational and pointless conquests, just so he
can feel good about himself. Adolf Hitler was similar too. The reason he
decided to set the blame on the Jews and to kill over 20 million people
in World-War-II was so he can feel good about himself. Also notice how he
constantly shifted the blame to his and his people's problems from himself
to members of other people, especially the Jews. Constantly blaming others
or the world at large for one's own problems is a vestige of what
Neo-Tech calls "The Criminal Mind".
</p>

<p>
Of course, even the Nazis were angels in comparison to 20th-century
Communistic regimes who had been responsible for <a href="http://vip.latnet.lv/LPRA/100MilVictims.htm">killing 100 million of their own countries'
citizens</a>. Why? Because the leaders felt that they were conspiring
against them, and that these victims prevent "future growth", but in fact
because they felt pleasure of doing this.
</p>

<p>
No reason for any human-induced mass-destruction have ever existed except
for the fact that the Charismatic leader was a destructive and evil person
(a "mystic" in Neo-Tech terminology) who wanted to feel good about himself.
</p>

<p>
But naturally saying "Would you kill a million people so I can feel good" would
not motivate anybody, they needed a "higher cause": "God", "the Aryan Race",
"the nation", "justice" (not real Justice - more like an egalitarian
revenge), "the Proletariat", etc. (And more recently "the Environment",
"our security", "fighting the drug abusers" and other causes like that). But
these causes are unnatural because there is no good reason to follow them.
</p>

<p>
Ayn Rand has identified that any aim to an unnatural altruistic cause, instead
of the real cause which is the well-being, freedom and prosperity of the
conscious individual, is in fact a recipe for disaster. By altruism she
didn't mean willingly and rationally contributing to the well-being of
another you care about, but rather claiming that one's life is worthless
without contributing or even sacrificing to an external cause, be it
"The poor", "the weak", "the nation", "the faith" or whatever.
</p>

<p>
As we remember the victims of the Nazis we should realise two things:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
If the Germans would have cared about their own well-being, been logical
and considered Hitler a stupid and irrational pip-squeak and nothing more,
then World-War-II would not have happpened.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the Jews (and other Nazi-opposers) realised they were in danger, and would
have marched into Germany and kill everyone that looked like a Nazi, the
War would have turned out much different.
</p>

<p>
( While I am a peaceful man, I am not a pacifist. I believe that when someone
is in danger, they are allowed to exercise force against their oppressors.
And sometimes it is necesary. )
</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>
The issue is not the "strong-vs-the-weak" it is the "noble-vs-the-evil", and
ironically some of the causes that seem the most noble to us are in fact
very bad.
</p>

<p>
Now it is your mission to try to apply what I said here. Act for your own
well-being and happiness. Oppose those people who tell you you should dedicate
your life to them. Ridicule them. Insult them. Fight them. Laugh them out
of existence.
</p>

<p>
Don't blame other people or the world at large for your own problems. Challenge
every assumption. Make sure you have no prejudice or dogma.
Understand that some people know more than you in some respects, and that
even the most wise men can (and often do) learn from fools. Be fanatical
for proper use of logic, which is the only valid tool that we have for
judging what's correct and right and what's wrong and bad.
</p>

<p>
Don't be a slave to your emotions and feelings. A person who's behaving
rationally will be happier in the long run than a person who's behaving
irrationally, and will experience more feelings of joy, happiness, love,
etc. Your feelings
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/books-recommends/#feeling_good">are
not facts</a> and only reflect our thoughts, and general condition.
While we want to be happy, we shouldn't make pleasure our master, but rather
our servant in the ends for a better life.

I was born on 5 May, 1977, so today is my 31st Birthday.
<a href="http://peachuk.livejournal.com/8840.html">peachuk has already congratulated me on her blog</a> (with a nice cartoon), and other people

also wrote me something on Facebook, which I tend to dislike. Next time,
an Email or an IM will do, but thanks.
</p>

<p>
I felt a bit depressed towards my birthday, but today I'm feeling great. Today
was productive for me as I worked on an XML grammar for
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">Unix-like
fortune cookies</a>. I learned <a href="http://relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a> in
the process (and can recommend it) and made some progress, but it's still not
ready for prime time.
</p>

<p>
I also chatted on the IRC a lot, and spent a lot of time explaining the essence
of Perl 5's references to someone who only knew Unix Shell and very minimal
Python. I remember I had problems with C pointers back after I learnt BASIC,
which didn't really have them, and still remember that I only truly understood
references in Perl after learning some Java (and possibly also after reading
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>).

<div align="right" dir="rtl">

<p>
יום עצמאות שמח לכולם! החלטתי לכתוב רשומה זאת לכבוד יום העצמאות, אבל קרוב לוודאי שחלקכם לא
תהיו מרוצים ממנה. הרשומה כתובה בעברית, מתוך רגשות פטריוטיות, אבל קרוב לוודאי
שאתרגם אותה אחר-כך לאנגלית ואדביק אותה כרשומה נפרדת.
</p>

<p>
מעשה שהיה כך היה: דיברתי עם
<a href="http://www.catonmat.net/">פטריס קרומינס</a>
בפרינוד, והוא סיפר לי שהוא עתיד בקרוב לסיים את התואר הראשון שלו בפיזיקה. (בהצלחה ומזל טוב!)
בכל מקרה, דיברנו על טקסי סיום בישראל ובלטביה (שהיא ארץ מושבו של פטריס) והוא הראה
לי
<a href="http://foto.lu.lv/arhiivs/2007/f_jun/04/index.html">מספר
תמונות של טקס סיום מלטביה</a>.
</p>

<p>
התמונה הראשונה שלכדה את עיניי הייתה
<a href="http://foto.lu.lv/arhiivs/2007/f_jun/04/slides/IMG_4806.html">תמונה זאת
של מספר בנות שככל הנראה עמדו לקבל את התעודה</a>. כפי שניתן לראות הן חמודות לאללה, אבל אני
מצאתי את התלבושות שלהן מצחיקות למדי ביחס למה שאני מכיר. פטריס סיפר לי שאלה
תלבושות פורמליות רגילות של בחורות שם, והוא שאל אותי אם אוכל למצוא לו תמונות של
בחורות ישראליות בתלבושות פורמליות.
</p>

<p>
טוב, ניגשתי לפליקר
<a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=israeli%20girls&amp;w=all">וחיפשתי "israeli girls"</a>
ומה אני רואה? מדים על גבי מדים. מרוב חאקי נהיה לי שחור בעיניים. תמונות
באיכות טובה של חיילות נאות, אבל זהו - אך ורק חיילות. פטריס סיפר לי שאותן תמונות היו פופולריות
ב-digg, ב-reddit ובכל שאר אתרי הקישורים החברתיים, ואולי זאת הסיבה מדוע פליקר מייחס להן חשיבות
רבה כל כך.
</p>

<p>
טוב, חיילת במדים (או חייל זכר במדים) אינו מראה כל-כך נדיר בארץ
בהתחשב בעובדה שמרבית הבנות משרתות בצבא שנתיים החל מגיל 18, וכן חלקן בוחרות לעשות גם קצונה
או שירות קבע. אבל מרבית הנשים שרואים בארץ אינן לבושות במדים. כך שהחיפוש הזה בפליקר
נותן רושם מטעה ופוליטי.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=israeli+woman&amp;m=text">החיפוש
"israeli woman"</a> אינו מציג רק חיילות אבל הדף הראשון גם הוא פוליטי משהו.
</p>

<p>
עכשיו מגיע תוכן ההתלוננות שלי: לדעתי ישראל נתפסת כמדינה היפר-פוליטית והיפר-בטחונית
הן בעיני תושבי העולם והן בעיני אזרחיה עצמה. אני אתן מספר דוגמאות:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
כאשר למדתי אזרחות בכיתה י‎"א המורה לאזרחות (שאני זוכר די לטובה) שאלה את הכיתה לאיזו ועדה של הכנסת,
ראש הממשלה מחויב להתייצב, והתלמידים ענו "ועדת החוץ והבטחון". אולם, הועדה הנכונה
הייתה "הועדה לביקורת המדינה" והמורה העירה שזאת הייתה אינדיקציה שאנו תופסים את הבטחון כחשוב
יתר על המידה (והיא העירה על כך גם לפני כן.)

</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/america.html">במאמר הזה</a>
פול גרהם הוכיח "מדעית", שזאת תהיה משימה חסרת-טעם להקים "עמק סיליקון" בישראל - כלומר
מרכז של סטארט-אפים. הוא כנראה לא שמע על חברות כמו
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirabilis_(company)">מירביליס</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_Point">צ'ק פוינט</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zend_Technologies">זנד</a>
ועוד סטארט-אפים ישראליים  רבים וטובים לשעבר. מרבית החברות שעבדתי בהן בתור מתכנת
היו סטארט-אפים, ולא חסרות כאלן, וגם היו רבות כאלו גם בזמן המיתון.

כאשר כתבתי את הרשומה
<a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php/A_Brief_History_of_Linux_in_Israel">היסטוריה
מקוצרת של לינוקס בישראל</a>
בויקי של Hackers-IL,
<a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php?title=A_Brief_History_of_Linux_in_Israel&amp;oldid=1528">כתבתי
במקור שלישראל היו בעיות רבות</a> וביניהן "מיסוי מרובה, רגולציה מרובה ולא רציונלית, כמות רבה של פעילות טרוריסטית וכו". מישהו (שאני חושב שהיה ישראלי) מחק את מה שכתבתי והשאיר רק את "הכמות הרבה
של פעילות טרוריסטית".
</p>
<p>
עם כל הכבוד, הפעילות הטרוריסטית הרבה היא לא הבעיה החמורה ביותר שפוגעת בישראל. ישראלים רבים יותר מתו מתאונות דרכים ומעישון מאשר מפעילות טרור. וכאמור, לדעתי, כמות המיסוי האדירה פוגעת בישראל באופן ניכר הרבה מפעילות הטרור, וישראל לא תפסיד דבר (ואף תרוויח) ככל שהיא תצמצם
אותה.
</p>
<p>
כך שהעריכה הייתה מטעה.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
מספר רב מדי של אנשים זרים שדיברתי איתם מחו"ל בצ'אטים באינטרנט שאלו אותי אם
ישראל בטוחה מספיק. ככל הנראה הרושם שלהם הוא שיש ירי ברחובות, וטילים בכל מקום,
וישראל איננה בטוחה. אולם המציאות היא שמרבית תושבי ישראל מרגישים בטוחים מאוד.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
כמובן, גם אני אינני טלית שכולה תכלת בנושא הזה.
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">הסיפור הרציני הראשון שכתבתי</a>
היה מבוסס על המצב הפוליטי בגבול בין ישראל ולבנון, אם כי יאמר להגנתי שיש לו מסר
הרבה יותר אוניברסלי. כמו-כן כתבתי
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/">מאמרים על פוליטיקה</a>
וכן רשומות פוליטיות רבות בבלוג שלי, אם כי לא כולן על המצב הפוליטי-בטחוני בישראל.
</p>

<p>
אבל אני חושב שיש לנו כעם אובססיה רבה מדי עם הצבא, והבטחון של ישראל. אם אתם שואלים
לדעתי, הגורם העיקרי שמצבנו הבטחוני מעורער כל-כך היא
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/define-zionism/">העובדה
שקיימת בישראל אפליה חוקתית</a>. עד שלא נמגר אותה לחלוטין, היא תביא לאפליה ולגזענות
רגילה, וכן ליחסים לא אוהדים גם בקרב הערבים ושאר תושבי-העולם הכי ליברליים. ואני אומר
זאת כישראלי יהודי. אם לעוות את מה
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda">שיודה</a>
אמר: "עשה או אל תעשה. אבל אל תעשה ליהודי ולא תעשה לגוי, או להפך."
</p>

<p>
בכל מקרה, בתור ישראלים ביום העצמאות, אנחנו צריכים לזכור שהצבא והבטחון
הם כלי ולא מטרה. המטרה היא שאזרחיה יוכלו לחיות חיים בשלום, שלוה, אושר ושגשוג. יום עצמאות שמח לכל תושבי ישראל!

<h2>2008-05-11: Israeli Independence Day Special: Enough with the Obsession With National Security! (English Translation)</h2>

<!-- Tags: security, israel, pkrumins, philosophy, politics, discrimination, rcaism, constitutional, arabs, palestine, problems, english -->

<p>
<b>Note:</b> this is an English translation of <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/53230.html">a previous entry which was written in Hebrew especially
for the Israeli Independence Day</a>.
</p>

<p>
Happy Independence Day Everybody! I decided to write this entry for the
Israeli Independence Day, but it is probable some of you will be pleased
by it. The entry is written in Hebrew, due to patriotic feelings,
but I'll probably translate it into English later and post it as
a separate entry.
</p>

<p>
The story went like this: I talked with
<a href="http://www.catonmat.net/">Peteris Krumins</a> on Freenode, and
he told me that he is about to graduate with his Bachelor Degree in Physics.
(Good Luck and Mazal Tov!) In any case, we discussed graduation ceremonies
in Israel and Latvia (which is Peteris's home-land), and he referred me to
<a href="http://foto.lu.lv/arhiivs/2007/f_jun/04/index.html">a few
photos of a graduation ceremony in Latvia</a>.
</p>

<p>
The first picture that caught my eye was
<a href="http://foto.lu.lv/arhiivs/2007/f_jun/04/slides/IMG_4806.html">this
picture of several girls who were apparently about to receive their
diploma</a>. As one can see they are incredibly cute, but I found their
costumes very funny in comparison to what I am familiar with. Peteris told me
that these are standard formal costumes of girls there, and he asked me if I
could find him photos of Israeli females in formal dresses.

</p>

<p>
So I went to Flickr and <a
href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=israeli%20girls&amp;w=all">searched for
"israeli girls"</a>, and what do I find? Uniforms upon uniforms. My eyes
became black from all the Khaki. High-quality photos of good-looking
female soldiers, but that's it - only soldiers. Peteris told me that these
photos were a hit on Digg, Reddit and the rest of the social bookmarking sites,
which may be the reason why Flickr ranks them so highly.
</p>

<p>
OK, a female solider in uniform (or a male soldier in uniform) is not such
an uncommon sight in Israel, given that most girls serve in the military
for two years starting from the age 18, and some of them also choose
to become officers or serve permanently. But most of the women we
see in Israel are not wearing uniforms. So this search in Flickr gives a
false and political impression.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=israeli+woman&amp;m=text">The search
"israeli woman"</a> does not display only soldiers, but it too has a very
political orientation.
</p>

<p>
Now here's the substance of my complaint: I think Israel is perceived as
a hyper-political and hyper-security-obsessed country, both by the citizens of
the world and by its own. I'll give a few examples:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
When I studied civics in the 11th grade, the Civics teacher (whom I remember
quite fondly) asked the class to which committee of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset">the Knesseth</a>, the
prime minister was obliged to be summoned, and the students said
"The Committee of External Affairs and National Security". But, the correct
committee was "The Committee for the Critique of the State", and the teacher
noted that it was an indication that we perceive the national
security as too important (and she noted that beforehand as well).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>

<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/america.html">In this essay</a> Paul Graham
proved "scientifically" that it would be a pointless mission to establish
a "Silicon Valley" (i.e: a hub of startups) in Israel. He probably didn't
hear of companies such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirabilis_(company)">Mirabilis</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_Point">Check Point</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zend_Technologies">Zend</a>
and many other examples of numerous, high-quality former Israeli startups.
Most of the companies I have worked for as a programmer in Israel have been
startups. There isn't a shortage of them, and there were many like that even
during the recession.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
When I wrote the entry
<a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php/A_Brief_History_of_Linux_in_Israel">"A
Brief History of Linux in Israel"</a> on the Hackers-IL wiki, I

<a href="http://www.hackers.org.il/mediawiki/index.php?title=A_Brief_History_of_Linux_in_Israel&amp;oldid=1528">originally wrote that Israel had many
problems</a> including "heavy taxation, irrational and abundant regulations, quite a lot of terrorist activity, etc.". Someone (who I think was an Israeli)
deleted what I wrote and left only the "large amount of terrorist activity".
</p>

<p>
With all due respect, the terrorist activity is not the worst problem that
hurts Israel. More Israelis have died from road accidents and from smoking
than from terrorist activity. And, as I noted, the high tax liability harms
Israel much worse than the terrorist activity, and Israel won't lose anything
(and will even greatly benefit) the more it will lower it.
</p>

<p>
Thus, the editing was misleading.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>

Too many foreign people I have talked with from outside Israel in Internet
chats have asked me if Israel was safe. Apparently, their impression
is that there is shooting in the streets, missiles falling everywhere
and that Israel is not safe. But the reality is that most Israeli residents
feel perfectly safe.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Naturally, I, too, am not
<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Hebraic_proverbs#.D7.98">a Tallith
that's entirely azure</a>.
My <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">first
serious story</a> was based on the political situation on the
Israeli-Lebanese border, although in my defense I must say that it has
a much more universal message. I have also written
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/">some essays about
politics</a> as well as many political posts on my blog, albeit not all
of them are about the political-defensive state of Israel.
</p>

<p>
But I think that as a people, we Israelis are too obsessed with the military
and the national security of Israel. If you ask me, the main reason our
security status is so terrible is
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/define-zionism/">the
fact that Israel has constitutional discrimination</a>. Until we completely
eliminate it, it will beget institutionalized and private discrimination and
racism, as well as non-supportive treatment from even amongst the most
liberal of the Arabs and the rest of the world's citizenry. And I'm saying
this as a Jewish Israeli. If I may contort what
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda">Yoda</a> said: "Do or do not.
But don't do for a Jew and don't do for a Gentile, or vice versa."
</p>

<p>
As Israelis in Independence Day, we should remember that the IDF and the
National Security are a means, not an end. The end is that the citizens
of Israel would be able to live good, peaceful, happy and prosperous lives.
Happy Independence Day to all Israeli Residents!

<h2>IRC Conversation: "Bunny" (Maybe Somewhat Offensive)</h2>

<p>
This conversation took place on Freenode's #perl the other day. It's funny,
so I wanted to share it here. Note that it may be somewhat offensive to some
sensitive females (or sensitive males), but I think it's pretty harmless
</p>

<pre>

  &lt;rindolf&gt;  B-rabbit? I know a B-rat on #linguistics.
 &lt;B-rabbit&gt;  rindolf, cool =]

 &lt;B-rabbit&gt;  my full name is bunny rabbit bt w :)
 &lt;B-rabbit&gt;  hehe
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  B-rabbit: ah.
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  B-rabbit: &quot;bunny&quot; is a female name.
 &lt;B-rabbit&gt;  lol
  &lt;pippijn&gt;  rindolf: correct
  &lt;pippijn&gt;  I know a bunny
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  Or a Playboy bunny.
       &lt;ik&gt;  rindolf: bunny is a stripper name
  &lt;pippijn&gt;  friends call her bun
       &lt;ik&gt;  pippijn: is she a stripper?

       &lt;ik&gt;  pippijn: right, but she&#39;s violating a fundamental law
       &lt;ik&gt;  pippijn: she either needs to change her name or become a
             stripper
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  ik: I think the other option is better.
  &lt;pippijn&gt;  ik: she&#39;d probably become a stripper rather than changing
             her name
  &lt;rindolf&gt;  pippijn: LOL.

<h2>2008-06-04: The Grammar Nazis Conspiracy</h2>

<!-- Tags: grammar, syntax, semantics, nazi, nazis, o&m, ozy, millie, conspiracy, linmagazine -->

<p>
<a href="http://mirror.hamakor.org.il/archives/discussions/06-2005/1878.html">Back
in 2005</a>, I wrote a message in Hebrew to the Hamakor discussions, noting
that illegal copying of software, as undesirable as it may be, is not
"stealing" or "theft". I signed my message "(The Semantics Nazi)" (in English).
</p>

<p>
Someone was offended, and after a brief discussion decided to publish
<a href="http://linmagazine.co.il/node/view/9351">this article</a> on
the front page of linmagazine.co.il (=an Israeli Linux news, blogs and forums
site). The discussion is very amusing. Someone asks "What does it have to do
with anything? Did Hitler use Linux?". Another one has misapplied Psalms 34,
there, while I had to correct him. In any case, I haven't stopped calling
myself and others "nazis".
</p>

<p>
Now it seems that <a href="http://www.ozyandmillie.org/d/20080528.html">Millie
is a "Grammar nazi"</a> and proud of it:
</p>

<img src="http://www.ozyandmillie.org/comics/om20080528.gif" alt="Ozy and
Millie: 'Grammar Nazi'" />

<p>
Since I am often correcting people's grammar, syntax, etc. (mostly in
Hebrew), I also consider myself a Grammar nazi. So I've decided to form
a conspiracy of:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Spelling nazis</li>
<li>Grammar nazis</li>
<li>Syntax nazis</li>
<li>Punctuation nazis</li>
<li>Idiomatic talk nazis</li>
<li>Semantics nazis</li>
<li>Netiquette nazis</li>
<li>Applied logic nazis (e.g: logical fallacies)</li>
</ol>

<p>
And may all "Anti-'nazi' nazis" be damned!
</p>

<p>
Here's for a better, clearer, and more correct human-to-human communication
(in all languages). Note that I always appreciate reports on errors in my own
text, which is especially problematic in English.

<h2>2008-06-08: Cognitive Behavioural Therapists' Summary</h2>

<!--Tags: cognitive, behavioural, behavioral, therapy, therapists, CBT, psychology, psychologists, tel aviv, personal, hypomania, mania-depressia, bipolar, disorder -->

<p>
I previously <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-il@cs.huji.ac.il/msg52046.html">wrote
to Linux-IL about me seeking a Cognitive-Behavioural Therpist in the
Tel-Aviv area</a>. I received several replies in private. Here is a summary
of them:
</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
I was referred to <a href="http://www.psagot.com/">Mekhon Psagot</a>,
which has a clinique in Tel-Aviv, in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_Square">the
Rabin Square area</a>. I went to a meeting with a therapist there on
Thursday, and it went very well. Note that it was an ad-hoc meeting,
until my usual therapist returns from abroad, and not the beginning
of a permanent commitment.
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
Someone referred me to <a href="http://www.mifne.co.il/">Mifne</a> which
are located in Haifa, so it was a bit too far.
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
Someone thanked me for my contributions to FOSS, and said he wished I'd be
well. Such encouragement is always appreciated. Thanks.
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
I got some other emails.

<h2>2008-06-16: Linux Computer Was Dead</h2>

<!-- Tags: linux, computer, hardware, problems, personal, log -->

<p>
In case you're wondering what happened to me the past few days (since about
Thursday), I have the following news. The Power Supply and some of the
ventilators of My Linux computer died, rendering it inoperational. So this
heavily disrupted my work.
</p>

<p>
Today my father and I replaced the dysfunctional parts, and restored the
computer. After we were able to turn it on, the network card was not
recognised, but moving it to another slot got it working again. No damage
was done to the hard-disks or any of the data.
</p>

<p>
That's all I wanted to say. Now, I have my Linux system back, and can
work in comfort again.

<h2>2008-06-19: Inflation of Singers from Reality Shows</h2>

<!--Tags: inflation, proliferation, singers, artists, music, songs, american idol, fame academy, katharine mcphee, last.fm, david bisbal, paris hilton, recommendation, media recommendation -->

<p>
As you may know, many countries hold reality shows / talent shows like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Idol">American Idol</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fame_Academy">Fame Academy</a>,
in which singers compete to win a contract, and the top selections usually
release singles or albums or otherwise become famous.
</p>

<p>
As a result there's now a huge inflation of such singers. For example,
I have <a href="http://wallpaper.skins.be/katharine-mcphee/28887/1280x1024/">the
following photo</a> of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_McPhee">Katharine McPhee</a>,
who was the runner-up on the fifth season of American Idol on virtual desktop
#1. Moreover, I once asked <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> to play me
one of her songs, and it wasn't too bad.
</p>

<p>
And finally, a Dutch friend of mine recommended
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVoNefPBoL0">this song called
"Silencio"</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bisbal">David
Bisbal</a>, who was the finalist on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operación_Triunfo">the Operación Triunfo
reality show</a>, and went on a solo career. And it's a really good song.
</p>

<p>
Talking with a friend about the fact that Last.fm played me some <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> songs,
of which I was fond of a few, he told me that he read somewhere that
such celebrities-turned-singers have become the last amateurs because all
the people from the reality shows have a lot of experience on their record
after they become famous.
</p>

<p>
Oh well.

<h2>Hebrew Words to Describe People</h2>

<!-- Tags: linguistics, moment of hebrew, philology, etymology, people, words to describe, men, women, girls, boys, guys, hebrew, english -->

<p>
This entry is dedicated to
<a href="http://peachuk.livejournal.com/">peachuk</a> and to the memory of
<a href="http://john-stephen-hearn.gonetoosoon.co.uk/my_index.php">her late
    husband - John Stephen Hearn</a>, who passed away recently. Thanks to
Altreus from IRC who copy-edited this entry.
</p>

<p> Before I start with the regular entry, I'd like to note that I went biking
through Park Hayarkon (a variation on my usual ride) recently, took many
photos and Flickr'ed <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shlomif/sets/72157605725109009/">the good
ones</a>. They are all Public Domain, but if you like them or use them, then an
attribution or a donation would be appreciated. Well, on we go.  </p>

<p> This time in "A Moment of Hebrew" I will cover the various words used to
describe people (= men and women) in Hebrew. I decided that from now on, I will
also link to the <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page">English
Wiktionary</a> entries of the words I'm discussing and possibly create an entry
or complement the existing one.  </p>

<p> I should note that as opposed to English, Hebrew is fully gender-aware: all
nouns, including objects are either male or female, whether in singular or in
plural. So let's go.  </p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%A8">Male -
Zakhar (זכר)</a>
and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%94">Female
- Neqevah (נקבה)</a></h3>

<p> Zakhar and Neqevah are the names of the genders. So we can say that a
"Hatulah hi Hatul mimin neqevah" which means that "A Catess (;-)) is a cat of
the gender 'female'". Some animals are actually primarily female like <a
href="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%94">"Anafah" (=
Heron)</a>, or <a
href="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%99%D7%94">"Dayah" (= Milvus)</a>,
in which case you need "Anafah mimin Zakhar" (= a male Heron).  </p>

<p> "Zakhar" comes from "Remembered", which may be because the ancient Semites
recalled who their male ancestors were (as is apparent in the "X Begot Y"
sections of the Old Testament), and didn't care too much about most of their
female ancestors. I was told "Neqevah" comes from "Niqbah" which means a
"hole", a "cave" or a "shaft" in Hebrew. (Why it is the case, is left as an
exercise to the reader.) </p>

<p> Note that the semantics and connotations of "male" and "female" are very
different from English. In <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105323/quotes">"Scent of a Woman"</a> the
boy describes a beautiful young woman sitting by (played by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Anwar">Gabrielle Anwar</a>) as
"a female". Al Pacino understands that he used it on purpose instead of saying
"a girl" or "a woman". However, if you call a girl a "neqevah" in Hebrew, she
will be heavily it's offended. It's something like "doll" in English, or even
more offensive. It's something Israelis of low culture use to describe women,
while knowing it is derogatory.  </p>

<p> I didn't hear the word "Zakhar" used for "a man" in a similar fashion to
the English "a male".  </p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A9">Ish (איש) -
Man/Person</a>, <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%94">Ishah (אישה) -
Woman</a>, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%91%D7%A8">Gever
(גבר) - Man</a></h3>

<p> "Ish" means more like Person, and Gever is more like man as in manly or
male-like. Like "Akhlah Gever" - "one hell of of a man". Or "Eizeh Gever!" -
"What a man!". Ishah means "a woman", but again, it may be a bit derogatory in
certain contexts. Once on a <a
href="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%92%D7%99_%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8">scouting
group tour</a>, a kid who joined us called one of my female peers an "Ishah"
and she said that while she technically was one, it was still derogatory to
call her that. A male teenager will also object to being called "Ish" or
"Gever".  </p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%9F">Son, Boy, Guy - Ben -
(בן)</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%AA">Daughter,
Girl, Gal - Bath (בת)</a></h3>

<p> While Ben and Bath essentially mean "Son" and "Daughter", they have become
to also mean "Boy" (as in Boyfriend, "or I'm going to the beach to catch some
boys".) and "Girl" as in "The girls went to work." - "Habanoth [= the girls]
halkho la3avodah" (where the "3" is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin">an Ayin</a>). The meaning is a bit
derogatory, but not enough for it to matter in everyday speech.  </p>

<p> Note that there's a slang term for "Banoth" (= girls) called "Bananoth"
which means "Bananas" in Hebrew. My female cousin once used "Bananim" (a play
on "Banim") too. This is considered rather old-fashioned in Hebrew, but may
become retro.  </p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ילד">ילד - Yeled - a
male child</a> and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ילדה">ילדה - Yaldah - a female child</a></h3>

<p>
Here we start deviating from English. In Hebrew, "boy"/"guy" and "girl"
have many different translations. Yeled means a male child or a boy, and Yaldah
means a female child. Note that children and adolscents up to high school still
call their peers like this. If a 16-18 years-old will say "Pagashti Bahurah
Babar" (= I met a "bahurah" (see below), a female guy in the Bar) he is likely
to be boasting to his fellows about meeting an older woman. (Similarly,
when swapping genders.) On the other hand saying "Pagashti Yaldah Babar" - I
met a girl in the Bar would imply he met someone of his age.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/נער">נער - Na3ar</a> and
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/נערה">נערה - Na3arah</a></h3>

<p>
This also means boy and girl but this time older, normally an adolescent or
teenager. Note that adolescents are likely to refer to themselves and
their peers as "Yeled" and "Yaldah". It also means a young lover (male or
female), or a young underling (for the masculine form) or a maid
(for the feminine form). In <a
href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bible#2nd_Samuel_2">2nd Samuel 2</a>,
they say "Yaqumo Na Ha'ne3arim we'Yesahaqu Lefaneino", which means "May
the boys rise and play (= fight games) in front of us". This is like a
corporate manager, or an army officer is likely to refer to his underlings
as "my boys", or like in <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111257/quotes">the movie Speed</a>,
where the Lutenant refers to one of his officers as "my boy, Jack".
</p>

<h3><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/עלם">עלם - 3elem - "he-damsel"</a>
and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/עלמה">עלמה - 3almah - damsel</a></h3>

<p>
3elem (with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayin">Ayin</a>) means a
young man in Hebrew, and 3almah (which is its feminine form)
means a young woman - a damsel, a maiden, etc. I'm not aware of a good English
translation to 3elem, which is unique in Hebrew.
</p>

<p>
In modern Hebrew these words are considered a little high, but still OK for
most everyday use. An 3elem or 3almah are somewhat older than a Na3ar or
Na3arah, already mature, but stil young. Some anecdotes:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
The Hebrew translation for "Miss Smith" is "Ha'3almah Smith" =
"the Damsel Smith". It's not often used in Israel, but you can see it in
translations from European languages.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
In <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1007.htm">Isiah 7, 14</a>
Isiah says, "And here the '3almah' get pregnant and bears a son and you
shall name him '3immanu'el' [= god is with us]". Now, until a few decades
ago, the Catholic Church's Latin translation of it read "And here the (female)
virgin gets preganant and bears a child", instead of "And here the damsel gets
pregnant and bears a child".
</p>
<p>
This was mis-translated to correspond to the reports in the New Testament
that Jesus was conceived in the womb of a virgin woman. It was recently
corrected in the official translation.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
There used to be (maybe there still is) a publication for teenage-oriented
Romantic novels called "3almah".
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h3><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/בחור">בחור - Bahur - "guy"</a>
and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/בחורה">בחורה - Bahurah - "girl"
or "gal"</a></h3>

<p>
בחור originally meant a Yeshivah student (comes from "chosen" or "selected"),
but it came to mean a "guy" in more recent Hebrew. Like "Bahur ehad
me'ha'avudah sheli" - "this guy from (my) work.". "Behurah" is its feminine
form ("girl", "gal", "bird", etc.), and as opposed to the English "girl", which
may be considered derogatory (at least according to some Feminazis) - it's
not derogatory in Hebrew.
</p>

<p>
Like I said previously, it's a term mostly used by people above high-school.
Note that in Hebrew in order to say "my co-worker told me about her parents",
you'll often say "Mishehi me'havodah sheli sipra li al Hahorim shelah", which
means "someone from Work told me about her parents.". Or "A Bahorah from
work". That's because saying "Haverthi la'3avodah"/"Haveri La'3avodah" (my
co-worker) is more unweildy and less natural for a Hebrew speaker.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
I think the entry is getting very long as it is, and I've covered most of
the important words. As can be seen, there are many words to describe people
in Hebrew, and to me it seems it is much more rich in this regard than English
is.

<h2>2008-08-15: Song Recommendation: Gomenasai</h2>

<p>
It's been a while since there was a soft song that I really liked,
but now my wait is over. Having discovered it on last.fm, I fell in love
with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL6dsH_BYsI">t.A.T.u's
Gomenasai (link to YouTube clip)</a>. Gomenasai means "I'm sorry"
in Japanese. Wikipedia has <a

I hope you'll find it as enjoyable as much as I do.

<h2>2008-10-09: Yom Kippur Summary - 2008</h2>

<p>
This is this year's Yom Kippur summary. As has been the tradition for several
years, on every Yom Kippur, I'm going over the blog entries from the previous
year and try to draw some conclusions.
</p>

<p>
Well, I'm going to be brief today. This year, I quit a job that I didn't
like (that had me writing email processing code in PHP with Sendmail and
MySQL running on the computer), and worked for 4 months in another job,
which I first liked, but then I found of its ugly side, which caused me
to stress out completely. I eventually got fired from it.
</p>

<p>
The second part of the year starting from April was characterised by many
periods of stress and anger. Part of it was due to me losing the job,
part of it was due to me trying to get involved in the August Penguin
conference, which was mis-managed, mis-organised, and where there was too
little essential communication, and part of it was due to my decision to run
to the Hamakor (the Israeli FOSS NPO) board (which I since cancelled).
</p>

<p>
This year, my Mandriva Linux Cooker system has caused me a lot of problems, with
a lot of elements of my computer working-environment that used to work before,
stopping to work for a time. I was able to fix most of them, but it
still caused a lot of aggravations. I should note that Cooker is the Mandriva
bleeding edge and is supposed to break. At the end of the year though I was
able to fix many bugs: with fonts, with the broken router I had that blocked
the Internet for my Linux machine, and now everything is mostly back to
normal.
</p>

<p>
I continued to contribute to open-source software this year, including many
things to scratch my itches, which I decided to release to the world. Often
the programs caused problems, or the co-developers were not communicative, but
as a general rule, I'm happy using Linux and other free software.
</p>

<p>
I worked on some stories and essays this year, which feels good.
</p>

<p>
So, that's it, I guess. Gmar Hatimah Tovah, everybody, and happy Sukkoth.

<h2>2008-10-19: Personal Update + Flash Game Recommendation + Music Recommendations</h2>

<p>
Here's another personal update. It's the Autumn Jewish holidays period now
in Israel, we spent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah">Rosh
Hashanah</a> in my Aunt's house in a Kibbutz near <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Galilee">the Sea of Galillee</a>. We
had the holiday feast in the back yard, with the family, which was tasty and
lovely. My aunt's daughter's son (my second nephew) was there, and he can
already
talk, and could tell us what each animal in his large collection of toy animals
was (in Hebrew).
</p>

<p>
I initially feared that I won't have a lot to do there, so I brought a lot
of puzzles from the newspapers to solve. But I found it, my aunt and her
husband had an Interconnected computer, which I could use and so did a lot.
It ran Windows XP, still had only Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 (can you say
no tabs?) and pressing the Windows Update menu-item did not appear to do
anything. I guess it was
likely already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn">pwned</a> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">Malware</a>, so I didn't
use it to login into sites.
</p>

<p>
While I was there I discovered <a
href="http://www.cuteflashgames.com/game/dig_it.html">this
Flash game called "Dig It"</a>, which I've been playing since, on and off.
I think writing an <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lm-solve/">LM-Solve</a>
backend for it wouldn't be too hard and will probably yield good
results.
</p>

<p>
I've been biking lately, about once every two days, and been taking walks
in the neighbourhood. I'd like to do some photo-taking-tours sometimes, and
upload the photos to my Flickr account, but I keep forgetting to take a
camera.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, I discovered a bag of instant
<a href="http://www.ivu.org/recipes/greek/majadra.html">Majadra (a rice
with lentils dish)</a> in the closet, which was slightly overdue, so I decided
to prepare it. Then when I tasted it, it had a strong leftover flavour,
so I had to throw what I prepared away.
</p>

<p>
Now for some musical recommendations. In case you've missed it
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_hsite/9285.html">on my
homesite's blog</a>, I now <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/links.html#music-free-downloads">have a free (and legal) musical
downloads section</a> in the links page of my homepage. It's still incomplete,
but I intend to work on it.
</p>

<p>
Here are some YouTube videos I've liked recently:
</p>

<ol>

<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewjxzSGmOGw">My Boyfriend's Back
from American Dreams</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If5phlHLOeQ">Ghostbusters' Theme
Song</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux49UBie-w8">Neil Sedaka -
Oh Carol!</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt6o8NlrbHg">Sean Kingston - Beautiful Girls</a></li>

<li>And the Obligatory song from the Muppet Show: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN5Mqr6tRlw">Hugga

<h2>2008-11-09: Personal Update: Lethargy</h2>

<p>
I'm still unemployed, and lately I've been feeling like I don't want to do
anything productive. So I spend most of my time chatting on IRC, browsing
the web aimlessly, editing wikis, etc. I recall having such periods before, so
I think it's just a mood.
</p>

<p>
I spent some time working on
<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Optimizing_Code_for_Speed">my "Optimising
Code for Speed" article</a>, and when I mentioned it to a MSN correspondent,
he read what I have now, and keeps encouraging me to finish it. As a result,
I've made even more progress.
</p>

<p>
I also had a long period where I felt shivers in the upper part of body.
This made me unable to bike or jog, which may have made my lethargy worse.
</p>

<p>
I released <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Dir-Dumper/">a new
module on CPAN</a>, which wasn't too much of a technical challenge, but still
scratches an important personal itch, so I'm glad I completed it. The
documentation is still very scarce. I also worked on Config-IniFiles, and
closed many of its <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a>
bugs.
</p>

<p>
So that's it for now. Hope you are feeling better.

<p>
<a href="http://www.brainbashers.com/">BrainBashers.com</a> is a great
site I found with many addictive
<a href="http://www.brainbashers.com/games.asp">puzzle games</a>. So
far I liked

<a href="http://www.brainbashers.com/logicgames.asp?type=fillomino">Fillomino</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.brainbashers.com/logicgames.asp?type=rectangles">Rectangles</a>, and there are some puzzles there that I was already familiar with.
One thing annoying about it is that the order of switching the states
of a square in its Nurikabe puzzle is the opposite from
<a href="http://www.logicgamesonline.com/nurikabe/">Logic Games Online's</a>.
Is it time for another small Greasemonkey script to fix it? ;-)

<p>
I've been to an Israeli Python-Web meeting on Tuesday, and it took place
in the Google Israel offices. They had a piano there, and I tried playing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Will_Follow_Him">"I Will

organ. However, no matter which tone-distances I tried, it did not sound
exactly right. Maybe I've become rusty.
</p>

<p>
Today when I slept, I had a dream where I heard some wonderful pop/rock
music to a melody I wasn't familiar with (at least not in the dream). Now
I cannot remember what it was. Oh well.

</p>

<p>
I bookmarked it, and after I saw him on MSN, I gave him the link.
However, he told me he cannot open the web-site. Now, he happens to live
in mainland China, and I asked him if he suspected that it was the

<h2>2009-04-08: Alphabets</h2>

<p>
First of all, happy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover">Passover</a>
to everybody. If you're Jewish - have a happy Seder today.
</p>

<p>
We once showed <a href="http://he.wikipedia.org/">writing in the Hebrew
alphabet</a> to an English IM-friend of ours, and she called it "Tetris".
As a result, the nickname stuck and our circle of friends keeps referring
to the Hebrew alphabet as "Tetris".
</p>

<p>
One day we were discussing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackal">Jackals</a>, and someone linked
to <a href="http://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B3_%E0%AE%A8%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BF">the
page about them on the Tamil wikipedia</a>. Then she said that Tamil "looked
like a drunk spider walked across the page!". Then I asked her to nicname
it in a similar manner to "Tetris" and she said she would call it
"curly wurly".
</p>

<p>
And the obligatory media recommendations: I really enjoyed listening to
<a href="http://www.magnatune.com/artists/albums/costlow-woods/">Rob Costlow's
"Woods of Chaos" album on Magnatune.com</a>. Costlow plays the piano, and
he has very moving and original melodies, with excellent quality. Magnatune is
a music publisher that publishes freely distributable music, and you can
listen to the album online.
</p>

<p>
And I also recently became addicted
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WAapKx2TvM">to this song by
Rihanna</a> (which isn't free),  so you may enjoy it too.
</p>

<p>
Happy Passover!

<h2>2009-05-21: Meeting your Blog Readers' Expectations</h2>

<p>
Recently, a prominent <a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl.org</a>
blogger (and a <a href="http://perl-begin.org/">Perl</a>
contributor) started posting many political posts to his blog, which
I found annoying and disturbing. After commenting to him about it, it started
a conversation and I ended up <a
href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=42958&amp;cid=68552">writing
a comment about the importance of meeting your blog reader's expectations</a>.
I'd like to copy it here:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
You say you only want to have one blog where you'll post about everything,
including political posts. In that case, let me tell you a story from my own
experience.
</p>

<p>
I used to have only one blog - first at Advogato and then
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/">at LiveJournal</a>. I posted
everything I wanted there whether technical or non-technical.
At one point <a
    href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/39551.html?thread=32639#t32639">I
    received some important input</a> in which that particular reader
said that they were not interested in my technical posts (like vim tips, Linux
bugs, etc.), and would rather have them separated. I commented (later in the
link) that I agreed, and so <a
href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/41970.html">started
    a separate blog for technical matters</a>. I also mention (in the
previous link) the fact that a blog I used to read and enjoy deteriorated
after its owner became a mother, and started posting exclusively about
her motherhood experiences. As a result, I unsubscribed from that blog's feed.
</p>

<p>
This separation of my blogs proved fruitful afterwards, because several planets
have opted to syndicate only the technical blogs (or in the case of Perlsphere,
only the Perl subset of them).
</p>

<p>
Moreover, when I discussed blogging with a certain famous blogger, he said
that he reached the conclusion that specialisation of blogs was the key to
success, and that people will only subscribe to blogs that concentrate
on topics that interest them.
</p>

<p>
My point is that in blogging, you need to meet your readers' expectations.
I am subscribed to the feed of all of use.perl.org's blog entries, because
I'm interested in reading what Perl enthusiasts say. I don't mind the
personal posts (or otherwise posts that are tangential to Perl) but I find
political posts disturbing and annoying and would rather not read them.
</p>

<p>
So far your blog has received no special treatment as I read it along with all
the rest of the posts. But if you don't guarantee that you're not going
to post political posts here anymore, I will filter it out, and stop reading
everything you have to say, including the Perl-related, and other non-political
posts. So you'll lose me as a reader and possibly some other people who will
opt not to read your blog.
</p>

<p>
It's your blog and you can post what you want to it, but I hope you understand
that your subscribers may opt out of it, if they feel your blog no longer
meets their expectations.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
I received quite a lot of heat in that discussion, in what seemed to me like
an innocent intention on my part to warn someone of an unpleasant trend in
their blog, before I unsubscribe. Eventually, he didn't take my advice,
and as a result, I
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/38969">wrote a script
to filter posts from use.perl.org based on the author</a> and am now filtering
out his posts from the feed I'm reading.
</p>

<p>
I unsubscribed from some blogs that started not to meet my expectations
before, but this was the first time I tried to warn the blog
owner about a bad trend.
</p>

<p>
I should note that once, before blogs became popular, I was subscribed to
a mailing list, where I've written many posts. At one point, I had written
many posts of a similar theme, only to have learned later from someone
else, that many people disliked them, and as a result decided to filter out
all of my posts to the list, while receiving the posts of anyone else (using
mail filters). I felt offended by this fact, and wished they would have
told me (or the list in general) how they felt.

<p>
Unsubscribing from a blog is probably less of an issue due to the technological
nature of web feeds, but I still think that if a blog that you used to like
has deteriorated in some respect, you should let the blog owner know, and I
hope to continue in doing this.

<h2>2009-05-31: An eventful day.</h2>

<p>
Two days ago I had an eventful day. During the second walk I took that day
(in the afternoon), there was a car that passed through the roundabout
at a big speed, shortly after I crossed the road there. Then, at the park
with the many cats in it, there was this woman who found a lost kitten.
She held him in her hand and said he had many fleas. Nearby, there was
also the corpse of a dead cat, which I had seen in earlier days, and we
also discused it. This woman was not from the neighbourhood and was looking
for the lady who was feeding the cats.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, there was little I could do and so I walked away, and on the way back,
in a different park I saw a pretty girl walking in the opposite direction
from me.
</p>

<p>
Later that day, I decided to go biking, and this time took my longer
ride through "Park Hayarkon". There were many people on the streets which
was expected of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavuot">a
holiday</a>. When I passed through the southern end of Tel Aviv university,
I saw the grey-and-white cat (which I
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/39551.html">told this blog about
earlier</a>) sitting on the fence, and stopped by. It was in a friendly mood
and I was able to pet it, and it even rubbed my foot.
</p>

<p>
When I returned home, I bathed and ate and was in a good mood, then I decided
to finally get to the task of forward-porting
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/bits.html#amarok">my Amarok
per-song-volume script</a> to Amarok 2.x. This took a lot of trial and error
and took me the rest of the evening, but I now have it written and it works
nicely. Hopefully, I'll tell more about it in
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/">my tech-blog</a>.

<h2>2009-07-10: Buying "Things Will Grow"</h2>

<p>
I spotted <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Things-Will-Grow/dp/B001EWBPL6">the
song "Things Will Grow" by the Sweethearts of the Rodeo</a> (which I really
like) on Amazon.com. The price was reasonable and it was an MP3 that was
promised to be "playable on iPod and all MP3 players". I decided to buy
it, but after I pressed the "Buy MP3" link, I got to
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/order/geo-filter-note.html?ie=UTF8&glCode=340">this "We are sorry…" page</a> informing me that:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We could not process your order. The sale of MP3 Downloads is currently
available only to US customers located in the 48 contiguous states, Alaska,
Hawaii, and the District of Columbia.
</p>

<p>
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
WTF? Do they really not want my money? And the ironic thing is that
I can watch (and listen) to
<a href="http://new.music.yahoo.com/sweethearts-of-the-rodeo/tracks/things-will-grow--840505">the
video of the track</a> without limits on Yahoo Music.
</p>

<p>
Do I really have to ask an American resident to buy this song for me, and
upload it to a server where I can download it from, and then compensate them?
Why can't I, as a non-American resident buy mp3s from Amazon right away?
</p>

<p>
buu from Freenode's #perl had this explanation: "Silly copyright cartels
being silly." Silly indeed.

<h2>2009-08-23: New Photos on Flickr (with High-Rez)</h2>

<p>
I finally uploaded all the
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shlomif/sets/72157621964578952/">photos
from a walk I took in March to a field near my neighbourhood</a> to
my Flickr account. They include high-resolution, 3072*2304 versions for
your downloading pleasure. Best of all, they are
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ">public domain</a>. Share
, re-use and enjoy!
</p>

<p>
The reason I delayed so much was because
<a href="http://kflickr.sourceforge.net/">KFlickr</a> broke, and I
didn't have the tuits to fix it and couldn't find anything
usable enough. I even started working on my own alternative Flickr uploading
(which I wanted to call UperLoadr). Eventually, however, the most criticial
Flickr bug has been fixed, and I was able to use it to upload it there.
</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shlomif/3793902479/" title="Black and White Cat Sitting on a Bench by shlomif2, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2589/3793902479_14f1e9b5f5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Black and White Cat Sitting on a Bench" /></a>

<p>
I now suspect that part of the reason why I'm not receiving too many comments
is because I haven't send them to too many
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/">Flickr groups</a>. So I'll probably
join more and submit some of my relevant photos there.
</p>

<p>
I'm also sorry for neglecting this blog in a while. Hopefully, I'll have
interesting things to blog about in the future. If all else fails you can try

<p>
Dear Sirs,
</p>

<p>
My name is Shlomi Fish, and I am a software developer, open source and
content activist, and writer of articles, essays and humorous stories. For a
long time, I am sure that Israel (like the other countries of the world) is
making a mistake in the fact that it enforces a prohibition on illegal
narcotics (such as Marijuana, Hash, Cocaine, and Heroin). While I never
touched these drugs, and I do not encourage their consumption, I believe that
the prohibition on drugs is much worse than the "Drug Abuse Problem" itself,
and even amplifies it.
</p>

<p>
In order to convince you, I', attaching an essay I wrote called "The Case
for Drug Legalisation", in HTML and PDF formats. (In order to prevent the

<h2>2009-09-05: Why Verbosity Can Be Good Sometimes</h2>

<p>
I once skimmed through a blog post by a
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> enthusiast, where I thought he
meant that popular art was somehow inferior to more obscure one. I told
him that writing good popular music was probably more difficult because
it had to appeal to a larger audience, and he said that he realised that.
Then I suggested that he should clarify it in the article, and that
he should "be a bit more verbose". He said he didn't like it and said
that "I don't think being more verbose is ever the solution in essay writing".
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure I had a ready answer then, but I think I do now. What I'm trying
to say is that verbosity is not <b>necessarily</b> bad, but that it can
be good sometimes.
</p>

<p>
As technical writers, we probably have been trained to believe that verbosity
is inherently evil. I still recall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">Pascal</a>'s
<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal">famous quote</a> that
said "I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.".
While it is true that it takes some effort to write essays concisely, I
still think one should still make sure to cover all points, and sometimes
be a little verbose, so the readers won't get the wrong idea.
</p>

<p>
While we can summarise many long essays in very little text, we would still
find it impossible to summarise something like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">the English Wikipedia</a> in say,
1,000 words. Our world is complex, and we often need a lot of data to
accurately describe it. So if we want to accurately convey a given set of
facts or opinions, we will require a certain minimum amount of words to
convey it.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, sometimes, as writers we will sometimes need to spend some words
in conveying relatively extraneous things so our readers won't
reach the wrong conclusions.
</p>

<p>
There is a word for brevity that is bad: "terseness" (as opposed to
"conciseness" or "succinctness" which are generally consider to be
virtuous). I think there should also be a word for good verbosity - maybe
"comprehensiveness", "clarity" or "completeness").
</p>

<p>
Is it also true for source code? Definitely. For example,
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware/">Joel Spolsky</a> says in
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html">"Seven
steps to remarkable customer service"</a> that "<q>Sometimes that means adding
more intelligence to the software or the SETUP program; by now, our SETUP
program is loaded with special case checks.</q>". All these "special case
checks" require more code, but they are needed to make the user experience
better. A program that does a lot will require more code (given a certain
implementation programming language and its accessible
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">APIs</a>), than a program that does very little. So we can expect that if we want
our code to be functional and user-friendly, that it will need to be longer
and take more time to write than a program that does very little such as
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">"Hello, World!"
program</a>.
</p>

<p>
So to sum up, sometimes one needs to write more, and there is no need to
be afraid of writing more. Sometimes these extra words will be beneficial,
and you would not need to remove them.

<h2>2009-09-28: Yom Kippur Summary - 2009</h2>

<p>
As has been the tradition on this blog for a few years, I'm spending
part of Yom Kippur reading my blog posts from the past year. Yesterday's
evening I read the blog entries since
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/55878.html">last year's summary</a>
and tried to draw some conclusion. This year, I didn't blog a lot on
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/">my non-technical blog</a> (this
one), and on the other hand blogged a lot on
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/">technical blog</a>.
I also published quite a lot of
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/shlomif/">photos on Flickr</a>.
</p>

<p>
I mostly worked on Perl packages this year, but also on
<a href="http://perl-begin.org/">Perl-Begin</a>, where I collaborated
with <a href="http://alanhieu.ml/">Alan Haggai Alavi</a>. Moreover,
I continued to work
on <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> and related
sites.
</p>

<p>
I published several new essays this year, and also worked on
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">my homepage's humour section</a>.
Two of my web-site's features hit <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>
this year - the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Mastering-Cat/">"Mastering cat"
April Fool's feature</a> (which some people thought was serious),
and
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/foss-licences-wars/">Open
Source Licences Wars</a>. The web-site and server survived both of them. :-)
Several other features were featured on
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/">OSNews.com</a> and other news sites.
</p>

<p>
This year I accepted a for-pay project for an Israeli project, but had to
cancel it because I got into a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">Hypomania (below-mania)</a>.
This was of no fault of the people I worked with, who were great,
or the project I worked which was very interesting, but rather of my
psycho-medical condition. I should note that in order to maintain good faith,
I did not demand any money for the project, gave them all the code
and documentation I worked on up to then, and agreed to provide support for
it to those who will replace me.
</p>

<p>
In any case, I decided that I should take some time-off to do some
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">Cognitive
behavioural therapy</a> work on myself, to try and make a living (possibly
small at first) from software development and from writing, and to relax.
</p>

<p>
This year, I sometimes got irritated at the computer for not working. I
eventually was able to resolve most of these problems, but I should expect
that, due to the fact that I'm working on Mandriva Cooker which is a
development distribution. I hope to avoid it this year.
</p>

<p>
I got into several Internet-related disputes this year, but as a general
rule, I've been doing OK. I also feel that I've matured in the sense that
many things that once scared me or irritated me, no longer do.
</p>

<p>
So it's been a pretty good year for me. Gmar Hatimah Tovah, everybody.

<p>
This is transcript of an MSN Messenger talk between
<a href="http://peachuk.livejournal.com/">peachuk</a> and me.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: I did buy Shania Twain's Greatest Hits CD and liked most of the songs there.</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: I also like many songs by Atomic Kitten.</p>
<p><b>Peach</b>: now that's the sort of thing my mother would like !</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Including some that I discovered on YT.</p>
<p><b>Peach</b>: Atomic Kitten - they have been and gone !</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Yes.</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Don't know what happened to their pieces.</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: The Spice Girls are also mostly gone.</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Though they sometimes merge to produce another song.</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: We have some temporary unites in Israel too.</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Kaverth keeps making performances.</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: They were known in Europe as Poggy [actually Poogy] or
something.</p>
<p><b>Peach</b>: I've not heard of them</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveret">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaveret</a></p>
<p><b>Peach</b>: I know the ex Kittens all have solo careers now</p>
<p><b>Peach</b>: mid 1970s ! No wonder I don't know them !</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Ah.</p>
<p><b>Peach</b>: Girls Aloud are the new Spice Girls</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Yes.</p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: They're pretty good.</p>

<p><b>Peach</b>: Cheryl (from Girls Aloud) has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMiy_UsrPDs">a new song out (link to YouTube)</a> - it's very catchy and played all the time here - sexy video too </p>
<p><b>Shlomi Fish</b>: Seems nice.</p>

<p>
And a recommendation for a film - the other day my mum and I saw
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252501/">Hearts in Atlantis</a>
on T.V. (also see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_in_Atlantis_%28film%29">its

unexpected plot. My mother and I greatly enjoyed it, and we can recommend it.

<h2>2009-11-09: Why Chinese May Not Become the Next International Language?</h2>

<p>
A lot of people I've talked about have been thinking that if and when China
becomes the next superpower, then Chinese will displace English as the next
international language (or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca">Lingue Franca</a>, which
is a common second, non-mother language). People say: "before English, there
was French, and before that, people used Latin", so it's possible English
will be displaced too.
</p>

<p>
This is all well and sound, but there is some historical evidence
that shows that often the local (or in our case - global) superpower has
displaced another while the lingua franca has not changed. As a result, it is
not certain that English will be displaced by Chinese even if China becomes
more dominant.
</p>

<p>
For example,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language">Aramaic</a> was
used as the lingua franca in the Near East during the reign of several
empires:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire">The
Assyrian empire</a> - in
<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b18.htm">the
Old Testament</a>, the Jewish diplomats ask the Assyrian diplomat who came to
Jerusalem to speak "Aramaic" instead of "Jehudan", so the rest of the Jeudans
won't understand.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaldea">The Chaldean Empire</a>
(also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Babylonian_Empire">the
Neo-Babylonian Empire</a>). After being exiled to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia">Mesophotomia</a>, the
Judeans interacted with their non-Judean peers in Aramaic, which they retained
after some of them returned to Judea.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_empire">The Persian Empire</a>.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period">The Hellenistic Period</a>
</li>

<li>
Aramaic was also spoken at the simultaneous times of The Roman Empire, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire">Parthian empire</a>
and the Persian empires. Jesus and his disciples used Aramaic as their
native tongue, and it was also extensively used for writing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud">the Talmud</a>.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Greek was similarly extensively used after the end of the Hellenistic Period,
well into the middle ages.
</p>

<p>
I can also think of some reasons which will make it difficult for Chinese
to displace English:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Chinese does not have an alphabet, but instead is using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character">a complex
logogram</a> which contains thousands of glyphs that are hard to learn and
memorise, especially for adults.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, from what someone once told me, that still does not make Chinese
books shorter, as they tend to be roughly the same length as their English
originals.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Chinese has a poor selection of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense">grammatical
tenses</a>. Whereas English has "to go", "went", "is going", "was going",
"going", "go!" and also distinguishes between singular, plural and first,
second and third person, Chinese only has one form for all of these. While,
they have some optional modifiers, they tend not to use them. That may make
Chinese poorly expressive for today's needs.
</p>

<p>
A Chinese correspondent told me that Chinese people tend not to think of time
a lot, in a classic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf sense</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
China has many English speakers, though their English often tends to not be
very good. I was told it is the country with the largest number of English
speakers in the world (by volume), but naturally, this will require a
citation.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
So I think that for better or for worse, Chinese will not displace English
as the international language, regardless of how much some
people think it is likely to happen.

<h2>2009-12-31: Conclusion of the Open Letter to the Israeli Government about Drug Legalisation</h2>

<p>
I
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/60773.html">announced that
I sent an E-mail to the Israeli Prime Minister and the Minister of
Internal Defence about drug legalisation</a> earlier on this blog. The E-mail
was sent in 18 October, 2009 and I didn't receive a reply, including not
an acknowledgement, an automated response or a bounce. It was obviously
ignored.
</p>

<p>
As a result, I have to conclude that the respected gentlemen have failed to
respond to me (a citizen and resident of Israel) on such an important issue and
are not fulfilling their duties as government officials.
</p>

<p>
Don't re-elect them - they don't care about you.
</p>

<p>
Happy new civil year, everybody!

<h2>2010-01-16: Personal Log</h2>

<p>
On Friday, I went to the
<a href="http://he.wikipedia.org/">Hebrew Wikipedia</a> meeting that
commemorated it having 100,000 entries now. I enjoyed the food there, but
left after the first round of lectures. Still, it was a nice refreshment
from what I usually did and I had to wake up early to come there on time.
</p>

<p>
Later on that day I worked on
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> and today I
wrote
<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/1035">a
report about it</a> to the mailing list. I also spent a lot of time cleaning
up my hard-disk and removing a lot of cruft, both from my home-directory
and the main partition.
</p>

<p>
Today was less intensive for me and I mostly rested. However, one of the
connectors on my glasses became faulty and as a result the right handle
does not hold up properly, and I need to replace it tomorrow. Very annoying.
</p>

<p>
Finally, here are some albums I enjoyed from Jamendo:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/56666">Justin Sound - Justin Sound</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/59248">LadyLau - Sense</a>

<h2>2010-02-23: Etymology of the Word "Cat"</h2>

<p>
According to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cat#Etymology_1">the
Wiktionary entry of the English word "Cat"</a> (for domestic felines, etc.)
it is originally derived from the Late Egyptian "čaute", feminine of
"čaus 'jungle cat". I guess the Hebrew word for Cat,
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%9C">"Chatul"</a>
has a similar origin, and I never noticed the similarity between the two
words until I've read the etymology in the Wiktionary. There are similar
words in other European languages:
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chat#French">the French chat</a>,
and <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Katze#German">the
German "Katze"</a>, and the Arabic word for Cat is
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%82%D8%B7">Qitt</a>.
</p>

<p>
Make sure you avoid a
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Mastering-Cat/">useless use
of "cat"</a>…

<h2>2010-02-27: Purim Special: The Ultimate Conspiracy Theory Behind the Story of the Scroll of Esther</h2>

<p>
It's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim">Purim</a> today, and
here is my own conspiracy theory for the events detailed in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther">the Scroll of Esther</a>
on which the holiday is based.
</p>

<p>
In my conspiracy theory, Mordechai was very interested in the politics of the
Persian empire, and sought ways to influence it. He got in contact with Haman,
a close childhood friend of the King, and gave him a lot of advice for
how to run the empire, which Haman delivered to the king by proxy. The king
was so impressed by Haman's good advice that he appointed him as prime
minister (or in Hebrew "second/vice to the king."). Mordechai also had proposed
his cousin, Hadasah (afterwards renamed Esther) as the wife of the king as a
way to further influence the king (or it is possible that Esther delivered
Mordechai's advice to Haman).
</p>

<p>
However, Mordechai, Esther and Haman got tired of all the proxying and so
sought a way to make Mordechai second to the king instead of Haman. So they
staged the rest of what happened. Then, after the night the king could not
sleep and requested that the royal records be read to him and then told Haman
that Mordechai should be honoured, was indicative that he also came to
understand what was going on and agreed to play along.
</p>

<p>
Meir Shalev in
<a href="http://bookme.co.il/Books/Item_Details.aspx?Barcode=40-10976">תנ"ך
עכשיו (= "the Bible Now" in Hebrew)</a> presents Mordechai as the master mind
behind the scenes of the plot, but acknowledged that there are many remaining
co-incidences. On the other hand, I go a step further, and make Esther and
Haman his co-conspirators, and so get rid of most of the remaining
co-incidences there.
</p>

<p>
Happy Purim, though it seems like it's a particularly rainy one this year.

<h2>2010-07-01: No one knows about Persian Cats</h2>

<p>
This post originated from a mailing list post by
<a href="http://thars-metal-lint.spaces.live.com/default.aspx">Chris
Green</a> to the writers-at-MIT.edu mailing list.
</p>

<p>
<b>No-one knows about Persian Cats.</b>
</p>

<p>
Filmed in Iran, the recently released film
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_One_Knows_About_Persian_Cats">No-one
Knows About Persian Cats</a>, now doing the film festival circuit, tells the
story of a group of young, underground musicians who want to do nothing more
than play music.
</p>

<p>In Iran there's a situation reminiscent of the sign posted above the
door of The Parliament Of Owls, featured  either in The Once And
Future King, or at least in The Book of Merlin, which was deleted from
the first title because its satirical attitude was frowned upon
during the Cold War.</p>

<p>The sign says something to the effect of “Everything Which Isn't
Banned is Mandatory.”</p>

<p>In Iran, a musician either plays Iranian Classical music, or they
don't play at all.</p>

<p>At least not publicly… :-)</p>

<p>The young musicians in the film want to play contemporary pop, heavy
metal, or World Music, and even jazz. To play any of this in such a
way that it comes to the attention of the authorities is quite
dangerous, and so clubs and recording studios are underground and
hidden away.</p>

<p>My understanding is that in a country where more than 50% of the
people are under 30, there are a lot of clubs like this. Some people
have filmed sets in these clubs and put videos up on YouTube, and
elsewhere, where I have seen them over the years.</p>

<p>There are some hot musicians over there, but I don't know any of
their names, except for one band which has relocated to the UK, one
named Radio Tehran. There are other expatriate Iranian bands and
performers, and there now is at least one record label (in the UK) set
up by some of the musicians to record and distribute their music.</p>

<p>While writing this, I realized the excellent word play in the title,
No-one Knows About Persian Cats.... musicians used to call themselves
cats, especially the hep jazz and rockabilly cats... so, no-one knows
(much) about the Persian cats, daddy-o, and the hep music they play...</p>

<p>Also, cats are banned in Iran, formerly called Persia.</p>

<p>I noticed many years back that the young people who have access to
the internet, cds, and old-fashioned cassette tapes, want to
experience and enjoy the same freedoms and opportunities that their
counterparts have elsewhere.</p>

<p>The underground in Iran is something of a pressure cooker, and one of
these days the older generation ( the ones behind the Iranian
revolution) and oppressive elements will start to lose control of the
oppressive political and social powers they currently have.</p>

<p>Things will boil over. Again.</p>

<p>The younger generations will want to have control over their own
future, as will the Cubans when things start to change there: in both
instances, the direction of the 'further revolution' (to coin a term)
will (hopefully) be dictated by the people who participate in it.</p>

<p>They want to change their societies and the lives they live, but on
their own terms: this is as it should be.</p>

<p>The best thing for outsiders to do is to not interfere (actively),
other than to occasionally offer encouragement and support, but to
generally stay out of their way.</p>

<p>
Here's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_One_Knows_About_Persian_Cats">Wikipedia page about this film</a>.

<h2>2010-09-22: Yom Kippur Summary - 2010</h2>

<p>
As has been the tradition on this blog for a few years already, I'm going
over my blog posts for the past year, and writing a summary of what the past
year has been for me. This is since <a
href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/59762.html">last year's summary</a>. I
should note that I have indeed gone
over the blogs on Yom Kippur, but did not get to write this summary until
today which is Erev Sukkoth.
</p>

<p>
Well, the trend of neglecting the non-technical blog continued, and on the
other hand I wrote many posts to my technical blog, including essays, tips,
thoughts, invitations to open source software-related events, reports on them
and rants. Nevertheless, I worked on my homepage quite a bit, although possibly
also with a technical focus.
</p>

<p>
Another somewhat worrying trend was the fact that I neglected to post a
lot of photos to my Flickr account. I hope to grab a camera and take more
photos soon, but I keep forgetting that.
</p>

<p>
Some of the posts to my technical blog have caused me a little grief this
year, but I've dealt with them pretty well. Starting from somewhere in
July, I started working for a Tel Aviv-based start-up, and so far it's been
going pretty well, despite some obvious technical difficulties. I also
did two projects for an American start-up for a payment.
</p>

<p>
There weren't too many severe stressful periods, but on the other hand,
I've been neglecting doing my
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">Cognitive
therapy</a> exercises lately, so I'd like to get back to them.
</p>

<p>
I've continued to work on open-source projects this year, especially on
<a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a>, on the
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/black-hole-solitaire-solver/">Black Hole Solitaire Solver</a>, on various Perl 5 CPAN modules,
and on KDE. I've also probably spent too much time on IRC for my own good.
</p>

<p>
This year I discovered a lot of great music on
<a href="http://www.jamendo.com/">Jamendo</a>,
<a href="http://modarchive.org/">the MOD archive</a>
and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>.
</p>

<p>
So, to sum up, a good year for me. Next year, I hope to write more stuff
on the non-technical blog, work on some essays and stories, and hopefully
to contribute to some open-source projects with many participants such as
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> which I've been missing lately.
</p>

<p>
So long everyone, and happy Sukkoth.

<h2>2010-10-23: Web Comics I Discovered</h2>

<p>
Today was an active day for me: I took two walks in the neighbourhood, sorted the
dishwasher, announced a new version of
<a href="http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/XML-Grammar-Fortune/">XML-Grammar-Fortune</a>
on Freshmeat.net, revisited <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=531785">my patchset to mozbot,
the Mozilla IRC bot</a>, washed my hair, and worked on
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">my home-site</a>. So what better way to
continue this trend than to blog here on my non-tech blog, which I wanted to do
in my Yom Kippur resolutions?
</p>

<p>
The topic for today is some web-comics I discovered recently and would like
to recommend. The first one is <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/">A Softer
World</a>, which combines some atmospheric pictures with words of funny
dialogues. I don't usually remember the contents afterwards and sometimes have
trouble understanding them, but it's still amusing.
</p>

<p>
The second one is <a href="http://spikedmath.com/">"Spiked Math"</a> which is
about mathematics, and very geeky. Here's a sample comic:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://spikedmath.com/311.html"><img src="http://spikedmath.com/comics/311-cn-fact.png" alt="Spiked Math Chuck Norris Fact" /></a>
</p>

<p>
For more about Chuck Norris see
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">my
Chuck Norris facts page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Another fine web comics, that I have less trouble understanding, is
<a href="http://www.calamitiesofnature.com/">Calamities of Nature</a>. It combines
dialogues of cartoon characters (very nicely drawn) with philosophical thoughts.
Here is a sample comic:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Here's the transcript:
</p>

<pre>
[[ Harold and Aaron sitting at a table, each reading a newspaper. ]]

Harold: California will be voting on a measure to legalize and tax marijuana
this fall.

Aaron: It's about time.

Aaron: Legalization will result in a major reduction of law enforcement costs,
open up space in overcrowded prisons, and raise billions of dollars for a fiscally
crippled state.

Harold: But what about the moral decay of society?

Aaron: Don't worry, we still have alcohol for that.
</pre>

<p>
For more about drug legalisation see
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/politics/drug-legalisation/">my
essay "The Case for Drug Legalisation"</a> and its referenced pages.
</p>

<p>
Another comic that I've come to enjoy recently is
<a href="http://www.just1randomguy.com/">"Just 1 Random Guy"</a>. It combines
the cartoon boxes drawn with crude computer graphics with text. Here is a sample:
</p>

<p>

It seems that staring at the comptuer
all day may be a bit less healthy than
previously assumed.

(1 Random Guy saying it with bleeding eyes.)

<p>
(I can related to that, because lately I've been having some headaches which we
suspect is due to heavy computer use.)
</p>

<p>
The final comic I'm going to recommend is
<a href="http://www.geekherocomic.com/">Geek Hero Comic</a>, which appears
to have been
<a href="http://www.geekherocomic.com/2009/11/16/taking-a-break/">discontinued

B: Wo-wo-wou hold it! Perhaps you mean we've got to reroute our packets?

A: No, I mean we've got to physically go there.

B: Like, change the physical address of our network cards?

A: No! Get out-side, get on a bus and go there!

B: A serial bus or a parallel one?

A: God, you go out even less than I do!

<h2>2010-12-20: New Essay: "Dealing with Hypomanias"</h2>

<p>
Recently, I've published
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/hypomanias/">a new
essay I've written titled "Dealing with Hypomanias"</a> on my homepage. I've
been suffering from periods of bad pyschological moods since I was 14 years
old, including clinical depressions, clincial anxities, hypomanias (=
"below-manias") and even some manias. As a result, I believe I have
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Bipolar disorder</a>,
but the psychotherapist I go to said he didn't diagnose me as such, because
doing so will have no implication on my therapy.
</p>

<p>
Lately, I've mostly only had hypomanias, and this essay gives some advice from
my experience on how to effectively handle them. I'd appreciate any feedback.

<div class="entry" id="copy-editing-the-enemy-hebrew-r6">

<h2>2011-02-24: Please Help Copy Edit a Hebrew Version of "The Enemy"</h2>

<p>
This is a call for people to help copy edit <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/the-enemy-prantemp/">the Hebrew
draft of the 6th Hebrew revision of my story "The Enemy and How I Helped
to Fight it"</a> which one can find on a temporary location on my homepage.
The .xhtml is viewable
in a web-browser (not Internet Explorer by default, though because it does
not support .xhtml files then - you can use Firefox, Google Chromium/Chrome,
Opera, Safari and most other standard-compliant browsers), while the file
ending with ".fiction-text.txt" is a well-formed plain-text based source file
that is ultimately used to generate it. As a result, if one sends UNIX-style
patches, they should be for
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/the-enemy-prantemp/The-Enemy-Hebrew.fiction-text.txt">that
version</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here is the abstract for the story, taken from my homepage:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A member of the terrorist organisation "The Organisation" gets up in the
morning, goes to his post and quits. But before he leaves he makes a suggestion
that causes his former comrades to fight each other to the death. Join the now
ex-Member of the Organisation as he embarks on an ego-trip, where he tries to
prove that A can in fact be non-A, regardless of what Aristotle could differ.
</p>

<p>
It's a political satire, but one that is universal in its message, and touches
on many aspects of politics, logic and Objectivist philosophy.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
The story is made available under the Creative Commons CC-by-sa open content
licence and I automatically assume that all the fixes to the story will be
licenced the same, while assigning me as the copyright (though naturally you
may request that I credit you on
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">the cover page of the
story</a>, with which I'll be happy to comply. If you're unhappy with that,
feel free to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29">"fork"</a> the story (in the open-source sense - not the Github
sense).
</p>

<p>
I've also set up
<a href="http://hhfg.wikia.com/wiki/User:Shlomif/The_Enemy_Hebrew_r6_Draft">a MediaWiki
page</a> for the story on a wiki on Wikia which you can edit directly inside
the browser, and I will integrate the stuff from it there (if you wish to be credited there, please leave a comment on the talk page.)
</p>

<p>
I hope you'll enjoy reading the Hebrew version (or
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">the English one on my
homepage</a> if you can't read Hebrew) even if you don't detect any
problems. I apologise that this entry is not
in Hebrew, but I did not want the non-Hebrew readers of this blog to feel
left out.

<h2>2011-02-24: משל יותם ו"היפה והחנון"</h2>

<div dir="rtl" align="right">
<p>
כבר הציעו לי מספר פעמים להשתתף ב"היפה והחנון" וסרבתי. למי ששכח,
זה מה שנאמר בתנ"ך
<a href="http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%9C_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9D">במשל יותם</a>:

<p>
אף על פי מה שנאמר שם, לי בתור אדם יצרני, אין מניעה להתנדב מלשאת במשרה ציבורית. אם
יציעו לי להיות ראש ממשלה, הרי שאשמח. אבל אין לי כוונה בתור בחור גיקי שמכבד את עצמו
לעשות מעצמי צחוק בתוכנית ריאליטי כמו "היפה והחנון", רק כדי להשיג את
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/fame.html">מה שאריק
ריימונד מתאר כ"פרסום זול"</a> וכ"אנשי פרצופים", שמפורסמים רק בשל היותם מפורסמים ופעמים
רבות אין איש מאחורי הפרצוף. אם וכאשר אתפרסם, הרי שזה יהיה בשל פועלי ויכולותיי, לא בגלל
שהופעתי בעוד סידרת ריאליטי דבילית שמהווה אופיום רע ביותר להמונים. אני בטוח שגם הבחורות
המושכות שיש להן קצת אופי וחוכמה, מספיק משכילות מכדי לגשת למבחני הקבלה של "היפה והחנון"
מראש.
</p>

<p>
אז בבקשה אל תטרידו אותי עם זה יותר, ואם כן אנא חפשו באינטרנט
את "שלומי פיש והיפה והחנון ומיצאו רשומה זאת.". יש לי הרבה פחות בעיה עם סדרות
ריאליטי כדוגמת "כוכב נולד" (בארץ ובעולם) שם המתמודדים מתחרים על כישוריהם כזמרים,
וזה מהנה לראות את זה (אם כי אני בחרתי שלא לצפות בתוכניות אלה באופן עקבי.). ראו גם
<a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/2008/06/19/">מה
שכתבתי על האינפלציה בזמרים מתוכניות ריאליטי בעבר</a>.

<div class="entry" id="one-thing-you-cannot-say-in-United-States">

<h2>2011-04-01: One Thing You Cannot Say in the United States</h2>


<p>
In the essay <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html">What you can't
say</a>, Paul Graham said that there are many things one cannot say in
modern societies, and that saying them will likely get you in trouble (sued
against, fired from your job or even get killed), despite
the existence and general acceptance of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech">the Freedom
of speech</a>. I felt Mr. Graham was right, but had a problem coming up with
such an example, and felt that "The Matrix had me." and I could not think
outside the box.
</p>

<p>
However, I recently came up with an example, and it was right below my nose,
and I'd like to share it with you. If you <b>ask someone about his cultural,
religious, ideological, ethnic, etc.</b> background while
<b>interviewing a candidate for a job</b>, you are likely going to be fired,
press charges against, or worse, due to the so-called American
"anti-discrimination" laws, which have taken precedence over the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">First
Amendment</a>, which among other things secures the freedom of speech. If
you don't believe me read what Joel Spolsky wrote about it
in <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000073.html">his
(otherwise excellent article) "The Guerilla Guide to Interviewing"</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
First of all, avoid the illegal questions. Anything related to race, religion,
gender, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status,
sexual orientation, or physical handicap is just illegal. If their resume says
they were in the Army in 1990, don't ask them, even to make pleasant
conversation, if they were in the Gulf war. It's against the law. If their
resume says that they attended the Technion in Haifa, don't ask them, even
conversationally, if they are Israeli. It's against the law. There's a pretty
good discussion of what's illegal
<a href="http://www.job-interview.net/Guide/SPstep4.htm">here</a>. (But the
rest of the interview questions at that site are pretty stupid).
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
There are similar things about giving "insider information" about your
company is doing (a complete non-crime), and about the
post-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin">Rabin</a>-
assassination Israel of saying that
"I'd like to kill the Israeli prime minister". <b>Note:</b> I'm not serious
about saying that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu">Mr.
Netanyahu</a>, the current Israeli Prime Minister should be killed, as much as
I distaste him. To quote the film
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/quotes">"The Princess Bride"</a>
"I want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice". All I'm trying
to convey is that saying something like that will likely get you in trouble.
</p>

<p>
I can rant about how anti-discrimination laws are not a good idea, and how
an employer can often discriminate against a job candidate, and how the fact
that you can only discriminate contracts based on money have made sites such
as "rentacoder" and "getafreelancer" into a joke, but I think I'll stop.
</p>

<p>
This was <b>not an April Fools' Day joke</b> (but see <a href="http://fc-solve.blogspot.com/2011/03/freecell-solver-goes-webscale.html">the freshly
announced Webscale™ version of Freecell Solver™ </a>), but it does seem
appropriate. Comments are welcome.

<h2>2011-08-07: Review of the Book Forrest Gump</h2>

<p>
I received the book
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump_%28novel%29"><i>Forrest
Gump</i></a>, as a present of gratitude after I tried to help someone with a
problem he encountered with <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell
Solver</a>. I finished reading it a while ago, and would like to review it
here, as a token for being given it.
</p>

<p>
The book is great, and I liked it better than the film (which was based on
it). In the film, it is implied that Forrest Gump is a retard, but in the
book, he is an idiot-savant, who excels in mathematics, music, and some other
mental activities. In the book, Forrest stumbles upon life, one weird happening
after another, in a very lovable way, and the story is captivating, funny
and entertaining.
</p>

<p>
I can recommend this book, and I also recommend
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gump_and_Co.">its sequel</a>,
which I had read before reading the first book.
</p>

<h3>Humble Indie Bundle 3</h3>

<p>
I suggest you look at the <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble
Indie Bundle 3</a>, which allows you to pay how much you want for seven
indie games, and split the proceeds between charity and the developers of
the games. I've bought the bundle (as I did the previous one) and am now
enjoying the game Crayon Physics Deluxe, which is great.
</p>

<h3>Personal Log</h3>

<p>
I've felt under the weather a while ago, but hopefully, this is mostly behind
me. In the past few days, I've kept myself busy by studying
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory">Group theory</a>, watching
episodes of The Muppet Show, translating some code from Perl to JavaScript
(which has given me a lot of fodder for my
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/javascript/">JavaScript</a>
page), and playing various games.
</p>

<p>
I've been feeling guilty about not having been following my RSS feeds for
a long while. I've started to
become not very fond of Akregator (the KDE feeds' aggregator), due to its
lack of RSS service support, and I feel that the developers' plan to port it
to Akonadi will make it even worse. I've found two other feeds' aggregators
(one for Firefox and the other one for GNOME/gtk+) either slow or annoying,
and so am left without an aggregator.

<h2>2011-10-10: Yom Kippur 2011 Summary</h2>

<p>
This Yom Kippur, I again went over my blogs from the last year. I mostly
blogged in <a href="http://shlomif-tech.livejournal.com/">my technical
blog</a> about tips and events and stuff like that. I did not mention some
of the significant good and bad things that happened to me on my blogs, but I
guess I have a right for privacy and/or they were of no interest to the world
at large.
</p>

<p>
The past year was good for me, but could have been better, and I drew some
conclusions from looking back.

<h2>2011-11-06: Joke: The Believer Rabbi</h2>

<p>
This is a joke my father told us the other day:
</p>

<p>
A Rabbi lived in a remote shack, and the weather forecast said there will be
a large flood. So two people arrived there in a Jeep and told the Rabbi:
“Rabbi, there will be a flood, come with us so you'll be saved.” and the Rabbi
said: “No, that's OK - God will save me.”.
</p>

<p>
And indeed it started to rain, and there was a lot of water, and so a boat arrived
at the Rabbi's house and the people there told the Rabbi: “Rabbi, there's a flood,
come with us and you'll be saved.” and the Rabbi told them: “No, that's OK - God
will save me.” and he remained there.
</p>

<p>
And it continued to rain, and the water level went up and the Rabbi had to climb
to the roof of his shack. A helicopter arrived at his shack, and the people
inside told the Rabbi: “Rabbi, there's a big flood. Come with us to safety.”, and
the Rabbi said: “No, that's OK - God will save me.”. And the Helicopter left.
</p>

<p>
The water levels rose even more, and the Rabbi drowned, and his soul went
to heaven. There he confronted God and asked him: “Dear God, why didn't you save
me?”, and God replied “Well, I tried. I sent you a Jeep, a boat - even a
helicopter - but you wouldn't accept any of them. What more could I have done?”
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The moral of this story is: God helps them that help God help them.
</p>

<h2>2011-11-24: Interesting Thought + Music Recommendation</h2>

<p>
I noticed that if I say to myself “Now I’m self-aware.” a few times and try to
follow this advice, I acheive a certain state of self-awareness. Eventually,
I get distracted, but while I do, it’s interesting. Try it, if you didn’t
already.
</p>

<p>
And for the music recommendations:
<a href="http://www.greensunmusic.com/">Green Sun music</a> is an Israeli
producer and composer who produces nice chill-out, new age electronic music.
The first three albums are available for free download, and I also bought
the mp3 version of his Dream Elements album, and can recommend it.
</p>

<p>
After I bought it, I mentioned Green Sun to my friend (on IM), and he said
that his friend had a band and that they released audio files on their site
and eventually got a record deal. I asked him for their site and he referred me
to <a href="http://machinaesupremacy.com/">Machinae Supremacy</a>. My friend
thought I wouldn’t like them, but apparently I did - it’s a Metalish-music
mixing many genres, with a rich sound, which I found likable (even if sometimes
it’s a bit weird.). There are many free downloads there, but the site does not
look properly with JavaScript disabled.
</p>

<h2>2012-09-26: Yom Kippur 2012 Summary</h2>

<p>
This Yom Kippur, I again went over my blogs from the last year,
and tried to draw some conclusions. Most of my
blog posts were in my technical blogs:
<a href="http://shlomif-tech.livejournal.com/">shlomif-tech</a>, and
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/shlomi_fish/">my blogs.perl.org
blog</a>. Nevertheless, I did not blog too much. Instead, I worked a lot
on code, wrote E-mails, chatted on IRC, and helped maintain such projects as
<a href="http://www.mageia.org/">the Mageia Linux distribution</a>. So I guess
it's not so bad, because writing and publishing essays has a tendency to
make me nervous.
</p>

<p>
I was employed for about 7 months this year in a part-time job, which
I expected to be more permanent and turned out to be more temporary. I also
did not have substantial
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/hypomanias/">hypomanias</a>,
though I had some periods of stress or anger, and annoyingly, I got into
a short period of hypomania yesterday, but luckily was quickly able to recover
from it.
</p>

<p>
I still maintained some sites such as <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">my
home-site</a> or <a href="http://perl-begin.org/">the
Perl Beginners’s site</a>, and it often kept me busy.
</p>

<p>
So overall a good year.
</p>

<p>
Cheers!

<h2>2012-10-15: Book Report: Catch 22</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22">The book <i>Catch-22</i></a>
by Joseph Heller has a reputation as one of the greatest books of
the 20th century. One of my family members bought it, and I recently finished
reading it, and would like to state my opinion.
</p>

<p>
While the book is well-written, I didn't really find it enjoyable. On the
other hand, there wasn't any particular obstacle to stop me from finishing
to read it (unlike some books I recently tried to read by Tom Wolfe), so
I guess it could have been worse. The humour in the book is sarcastic and
dry, and I usually did not find it funny.
</p>

<p>
At least now I can boast that I have read Catch-22, and other people may
find it more enjoyable. Bye for now.

<h2>2012-09-26: Yom Kippur 2013 Summary</h2>

<p>
This Yom Kippur, I again went over my blogs from the last year,
and tried to draw some conclusions. (It's already Sukkoth and
<a href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html">Talk Like a Pirate
Day</a>, so I decided to blog about this already.). I again noticed
that I didn't blog a lot most of the time, but I guess no real disaster
occured due to that.
</p>

<p>
This year I had a lengthy
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/hypomanias/">hypomania</a>,
which was followed by a period of working a lot on code, and then
a period of tiredness and feeling of lethargy (though I was almost always
constantly doing something), and now I've started working as a software
developer, which keeps me busy. The Hypomania made me realise several things
that I have done or thought wrong, so it was not too bad.
</p>

<p>
This year I finished some books, watched some films, added a lot of content
to my home site, and made some new friends online and offline, so I can be
proud of myself.
</p>

<p>
There were a few times, when I got into some trouble or made people angry,
especially during the hypomania, but I hope I have drawn the right conclusions.
</p>

<p>
Shanah Tovah, Gmar Hatimah Tovah, Happy Sukkoth, and Happy Talk Like a Pirate
Day to everybody.
