In my screenplay, http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/ , in a scene which takes place in France of king Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, two of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musketeers_of_the_Guard in uniforms come to inform the woman who tells the story, that the king wishes to see her. She immediately complied.

I believe the Musketeers of the Guard back then were the rough old and French equivalent of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs or the Israeli https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayeret_Matkal . So why is it important?

One thing that concerns me is that in Germany most of YouTube (everything that has music) is blocked due to a dispute by GEMA, a German Copyrights Cartel - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_of_YouTube_videos_in_Germany . As a result, many people use proxies in Britain/etc. or depend on their foreign friends to upload the videos elsewhere. And this is an unnecessary man-made problem.

So what I suggest is that two soldiers from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Special_Forces (who probably have to suffer through the YouTube blocking shenanigan will during a break from the military, visit the GEMA directors (while not lying about who they are, not carrying a gun, and not in uniform), and have friendly chat with them about why GEMA are being silly, old-fashioned, dicks. Saladin style! #SummerNSA

This is just my suggestion - feel free to ignore. Or not.
