<h2>2009-02-17: How Ubuntu Has Excluded Me</h2>

<p>
For a long time, I felt that it was hard to get the point of <a
href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/11379.html">my
"Ubuntu is Dead" post</a> because it just featured a breadcrumbs trail
without fully telling the story of the chains of events that I complained
above. In this post, I'll try to remedy this, and tell of my encounter
with the Ubuntu online world from start to finish.
</p>

<p>
It is commonly acceptable that when complaining about an organisation,
one should first enumerate the facts, and I intend to obey by it. However,
along with the facts, I'll explain some of my motivation for doing what I did.
After that, I'll enumerate the problems I see with my treatment, and give
some suggestions.
