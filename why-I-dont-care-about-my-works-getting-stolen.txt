I know that, and I'm planning to get such permission when I want to take my
books to the next, more professional, level beyond just Internet publication.

1. Regarding stealing here is what I wrote in 
http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/revision-3/#term_stealing_theft
:

<QUOTE>

Copyright apologists like to say that copying a work that is copyrighted and
was published to the public, is equivalent to “stealing” or “theft”. However,
stealing involves taking tangible property without permission, and depriving
the owner of one less instance of it. On the other hand, with a public work, we
can make an unlimited number of copies, while not harming the original, and
while respecting the exclusive rights of the author for his work. This is
because we just copy it - we don’t claim it is ours.

Accusing people who share or duplicate media non-commercially of “stealing”
obscures two other forms of media-related crimes that are in fact stealing:

1.    If someone has somehow gained access to my private files and used it to
prepare his own copies (or worse delete the originals), then he has performed
stealing. Not of “Intellectual Property” but of actual property, because the
files are private and I do not wish them to be inspected by someone else. And
privacy must be respected.

2.    If someone has made an inclusive work of someone’s else’s work, and
claimed it was his, then it may be called “stealing” of copyrights. 

But copying a work that was released for public consumption, can never be
considered “stealing”. Instead it is merely “copying”, “swapping”, “sharing”,
etc.

2. Secondly, regarding building upon my "hard" work and creative a derivative
version, not only do I not mind, but I encourage it:

* My work is under CC-by, CC-by-sa, CC-by-nc and CC-by-nc-sa which allow for
creative derivative works under a similar - or sometimes different - licence.

* I licensed all the worlds, characters, and concepts in my stories under the
CC-by.

For all that see:

* http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/copyrights/

(I require attribution, but otherwise you should be OK.)

Also see xkcd's "Steal This Comic" - https://xkcd.com/488/ .

I should note that historically copyright did not apply to characters, concepts
and worlds, it's just that it became maximalistic like that more recently.

So I practise and apply what I preach. :-).
