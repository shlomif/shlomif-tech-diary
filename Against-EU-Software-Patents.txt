My name is Shlomi Fish and I am a user, developer and advocate of
Open Source Software. I would like to take this stand and urge all
representatives of the European Parliament to vote against software patents
in Europe. The reason is that software patents are harmful more often than
not.

The vast majority of software patents that were accepted are either very
trivial, have a lot of prior art, or both. They are used to harass innocent
developers and software vendors that supposedly violate them. Recently we have
seen the rise of companies and individuals who try to make a living off
gathering many patents and then suing people for supposed patent violations.
Even Microsoft was involved in two such lawsuits in the recent past. (in which
it lost despite the fact both patents were very trivial)

The software patents that are actually valid, also don't bring any benefit.
A software developer is better off continually innovating and working on
building a better product than trying to protect his innovations with patents.
Patent litigation gives a lot of negative publicity, costs a lot of money, and
deprive a lot of time that can be invested in productive work.

The best thing in the long run is to make sure patents software have no legal
basis. This would be the best outcome for big, medium and small companies. It
would also be the best outcome for Europe as 80% of the software patents that
were accepted so far in Europe are registered for people outside of Europe.

Sincerely yours,

    Shlomi Fish
