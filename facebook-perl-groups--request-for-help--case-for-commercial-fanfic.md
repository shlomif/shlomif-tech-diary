Inspired by Randal's post (
https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/permalink/4091930907506333/
), now it's my turn asking for help. As opposed to him, while I always accept
monetary donations ( https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/donate/ ), I am supported
by my parents and national insurance, and have some savings, so I can give
you monetary donations. ( Which you may opt to return or not given https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=smg-about-giving-back-money-and-time ).

But what I need more is Internet/social media/etc. publicity (yes, fame! It's not bad: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/meaning-of-able-competent.xhtml ) for my latest world healing / world-savioring effort:

Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as 2021 geek/hacker imperatives for revitalising the film industry

(Or the "case for commercial fan-fiction" for short)

I think (and try to prove) that it (as well as screenreaders accepting screenplays in easier-to-validate format and pinpointing the precise faults for disapproval) are logical steps in the "open / free / share / remix" trend.

So I could use reposts / shares / comments / criticisms (see http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/ ) and will even try to link to them from the main article.

Also note that you can contact me in private ( https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/ ) about adding real or virtual donations of money to my virtual donations' ledger while soliciting work on FOSS / free culture works. I trust you won't be dicks ( https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law ) and overcharge me, but in any case, the sums are just guidelines, and I'm not promising I will allocate time for them soon. (My preferred currency for virtual donations is US Dollars.)
