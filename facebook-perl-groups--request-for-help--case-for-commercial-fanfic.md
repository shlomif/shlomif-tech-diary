Inspired by Randal's post where he requested financial help (
https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/permalink/4091930907506333/
), now it's my turn asking for help. As opposed to his request, while I always accept
monetary donations ( see https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/donate/ ), I am currently supported
by my parents and national insurance, and have some savings, so I can even give
you monetary donations. You may opt to return them or not return them, given my reluctance to overload my memory with who-owes-me-how-much, but more importantly my observation that generosity pays back in spades: https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=smg-about-giving-back-money-and-time .

But what I need more is Internet, social media/etc. publicity for my latest world healing / world-saving effort. Yes, fame! People have looked down upon fame recently, but I feel fame is a good thing: https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/meaning-of-able-competent.xhtml

Anyway, the effort is:

«
Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as 2021 geek/hacker imperatives for revitalising the film industry
»

(Or the "Case for Commercial Fan-Fiction" for short)

I think, and tried to prove, that accepting commercial fanfic, as well as screenreaders accepting screenplays in easier-to-validate format and pinpointing the precise faults for disapproving of them, are logical steps in the "open / free / share / remix" trend ( "open source", "open content" ).

So I could use reposts / shares / comments / criticisms (see http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/ ) and will even try to link to them from the main article. As an experiment, I enabled https://github.com/utterance/utterances/ - based comments on the page (which require a GitHub login to comment), and pull requests / patches to the sources are welcome as well.

Also note that you can contact me in private ( https://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/ ) about having added financial donations (whether real or implied) to my  ledger of virtual donations, while requesting my future work on FOSS / free culture works. I trust you won't be dicks ( https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law ) and overcharge me, but in any case, the sums are just guidelines, and I'm not promising I will allocate time for them soon. (My preferred currency for virtual donations is US Dollars.)
