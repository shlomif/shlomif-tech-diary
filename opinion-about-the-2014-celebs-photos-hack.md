(Reposted from https://www.facebook.com/shlomi.fish/posts/10152256460346981 ).

Here's what I think of the recent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_pictures_hack (so-called "fappening"). Caveat Emptor: that's what I think of it now. I may change my mind.

First of all, it was a violation of privacy. The files one keeps on their computers or "cloud" accounts - whether text, photographs, videos, music, code, rich text, multimedia or whatever, - are their and their alone, and unless they were made available on a publicly available forum - they should not be distributed.

But I think there's a more important point here that people don't realise or agree about. I had mentioned in this tweet - https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/478025441983213569 - «A woman is a lady even if she is or was a porn actress or a prostitute . Treat her with respect, be honest to her - be a gentleman» (And naturally every man is a gentleman for the same reason). There is still a lot of antagonism from people doing some sexually "offensive" acts like posing naked, filming sex videos, taking part in porn films, practising prostitution, etc. But why? It's not as if anyone gets harmed from them, except for possibly being deeply offended, which is actually a feeling that there's a big truth that you don't want to admit - http://shlomif.wikia.com/wiki/Sources_of_Enlightenment#Encourage_Criticism_and_People_who_Offend_You .

As you may know, I have deep admiration for truly inspiring women like #JenniferLawrence , #SummerGlau,  #EmmaWatson, #MeganFox or #SarahMichelleGellar , but mark my words: if any one of them tomorrow decided to willingly star in a hardcore pornographic film ("XXXXXXX..." to infinity), or to start a business of giving sexual services for money, (much less if they posed naked or topless or whatever), then after a short shock, I won't think any less of them.

Moreover, I also won't think less of my family and close friends if any of them did that!

So my suggestion to the affected celebrities is to:

1. Not try to hunt the providers of the photos online. (This will be futile and make them look bad.)

2. Make the bold claim that it won't make them any less of a role model if they did that deliberately, and that a woman or a man can and may willingly do all that (or whatever they choose), by accordance with their rights on their body. Whether or not any individual do all that is ultimately their choice.

3. Take all the Media frenzy about it to their advantage. ("Any publicity is good publicity").

We are already seeing various social stigma about #sexuality getting broken. Recently, I was told that after #MirandaKerr got separated from her husband, she's been boasting in magazines about all the "great sex" she's been getting from various willing men. Back in the 90s people would have called her a slut and a bimbo. A while before I heard of it, I had this to write in http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/ :

> Willow: So, do you think I should get a dog?

> Buffy: Oh, my friend, Rachel, that software developer chick who moved here, told me that ever since she bought a dog, she made so many friends and lots of guys showed interest in her, and she’s been telling me about her exploits with them endlessly.

> Willow: So she has become a slut? So cool!

> Faith: Hey! “Slut” is such a 90s term. The new name for that is “polyamorous”!

(There's a slight semantic difference between a "slut" and a polyamorous person but you get the idea.)

Thing is as long as you don't get yourself killed or badly injured (which is within your right to do but is incredibly stupid) or exhibit force, threat of force, or fraud against someone or their personal and/or private property, you can do or say whatever you want.
