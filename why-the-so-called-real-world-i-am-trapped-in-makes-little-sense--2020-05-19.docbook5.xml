<title>The epistemological demons:</title>
<para>We seem to be dealing with epistemological demons.</para>
<para>I exhibit a Descarteseque <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon">Evil demon</link> - like situation. The demon contorts my perception of the outside world, and may input false emotions and the occasional false thought, but I still have my centre-of-consciousness (aka "the soul", or "the ego"), logic, reason, and older memories.</para>
<para>I believed reality is what was told it must be (by decree of "Science" or "common sense") rather than what I <emphasis role="strong">wanted</emphasis> it to be ( re <link linkend="selinaverse_vision">The Selinaverse vision</link> ). As a result, the demon increasingly tried to convince me the world was getting worse, and that I was increasingly ignored, isolated, and unpopular.</para>
<para>But I now know it isn&#8217;t and cannot be so. I want the world and the multiverse as I want them!</para>
<para>I do not wish to <link xl:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Self-Sufficiency/">obey this silly non-reality of yours any more</link>. I&#8217;m going to <link xl:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Mc-NYPHaQ">break free</link> and will take all the people I&#8217;ve known with me.</para>

<para>"People" online are afraid of <link xl:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">critics and contrarians</link> and yet sadistic enough to ban non-spammers.</para>

<para>⇒ The media keeps saying that there&#8217;ll be shortages of certain products, but it doesn&#8217;t happen.</para>

<para>I think there has been a conspiracy of the demons inside me to try to convince me that the world outside me was getting worse, and that I was more and more isolated, friendless and unpopular. Well, game over - I won - you will lose!</para>

<para>There are thousands' years old hackers (aka "vampires") and below-20 ones who are huge fans of one another: <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/kai-blanche.xhtml">https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/kai-blanche.xhtml</link> .</para>

However it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because many Terran scientists and engineers and developers were highly concerned about efficiency and reliability and other kinds of <link xl:href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomi-fish-homepage/blob/master/lib/notes/quality-software&#8212;&#8203;followup-2018.md">quality</link>.

As a result, Earth became a hub for technology - both tangible and intellectual and lately digital as well.</para>

<para>As a child, I wanted to be good-hearted (= noble, honest, benevolent) and later on aspired to be world savior / messiah / "the greatest person in history". I guess "nice guys finish last".</para>

<para>I have a very low number of Twitter followers (below 650 - <link xl:href="https://twitter.com/shlomif">https://twitter.com/shlomif</link> ) and my reddit posts are usually not upvoted a lot ( <link xl:href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shlomif">https://www.reddit.com/user/shlomif</link> ) .

<para>In my opinion, it was completely unnecessary. Perhaps they thought that without those brainwashes we would have reached the conclusion that there is no rationale behind the activity against the Enemy.

<para>The devils held Planet Earth in a mind hell. Humans had egoes but were "false prophets" and listened to the devils’ mutations of the utterances of the gods/leaders and perceived reality differently in their mediums.</para>
<para>Nevertheless, many false prophets ascended, relinquished all their fears, and became fearless immortal "true prophets". That caused the psycho-geographical region to stop being a hellhole (possibly without its Capital at first).</para>
<para><link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel">The Land_of_Israel</link> was particularly problematic because it was segmented into many territories.</para>

<para>All the remaining false prophets were avid fans of The Muppet Show , but may have thought it was considered silly and childish among the general public.

<title>The Terran Terminators:</title>
<para>Anyway, the devils did not give up easily, and offerred the sentient men and
women who just reached enlightenment a deal: they can opt to spend the summer
enlightened and together having fun and using their magical powers. At its end,
they can opt to reset their memory banks almost completely and become false
prophets again, or continue as enlightened true prophets.</para>
<para>Several newly-ascended true prophets opted out, from various reasons.</para>
<para>The remaining spent the summer there creating many crossover memes, stories,
and franchises, or otherwise enjoying magic, life, love/etc.. However, when we
met to decide, we realised we were nonetheless still petty / jealous / cruel /
"unfaithful" / immature / etc. Some had years, or decades (or more?) of history
they wanted to get rid of. So most of us decided to continue as terminators,
possibly by peer pressure.</para>
<para>Except at least one: the circa 1977-born Selina Mandrake.</para>
<para>Becoming terminators was advantageous because the devils-and-Orcs promised they would reveal <link xl:href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1403966571215740929">TheOneTruth™</link> to the last one standing, but more importantly, all terminators will harbour many new franchises, plots and meme values.</para>

<section xml:id="king-solomon">
<title>The story of King Solomon-son-of-David (the Biblical one):</title>
<para>After Syria (minus Damascus itself) in the levant ascended to being a true
prophets zone (by Mosheh / Aharon / Nimrod ?), The-Curse splintered the modern
day State of Israel into 12 or 13 parts, and .uk into many shires and
Scottish clans and promised they won&#8217;t do it again. Note that pre-Levantine
was modern Hebrew (which was spoken by <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/Q_home_planet.xhtml">the Englishtants over 6 milliard years ago</link>) and Modern English is also a product of The-Curse.</para>
<para>Anyway, the tribe of Yehudah (except their Capital, Jerusalem) ascended when David "slew" Goliath by almost hitting him with a sling (<link xl:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE2TZAdoaS8">"I missed on purpose; I can kill you now"</link>) and telling him the Judeans and Philistines should become friends.</para>
<para>Nevertheless, two false prophets parents gave birth to a false prophet-at-first son in Jerusalem. He became King "Shlomi" (written as "Shlomo" in <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_Codex">Aleppo Codex</link> ) which means <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/your_name.xhtml">Shalom-ful</link> in Hebrew. Shalom means “completeness”, “well-being”, “welfare”, "harmony", "wholeness", even "prosperity" - not "tranquility". While he could suffer some hardships and pain, his body, mind, soul and heart, must remain complete and intact and prosper.</para>
<para>King Shlomo wanted to be benevolent and "know the gods". He became king by telling well-intenioned jokes and tall tales about his older siblings-in-pretence (e.g: <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_(daughter_of_David)">Amnon and Tamar</link> or <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absalom">Avshalom</link>). Not unlike <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">my fanfics/RPF</link>. They agreed he would be a better king and crowned him, while remaining physically alive and loyally serving under Shlomo&#8217;s reign.</para>
<para>( Note that in the Selinaverse <link xl:href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Winn_Adami">Vedek Winn</link> became Kai by employing a similar strategy. The rule that you should not use the same trick twice is just a guideline: <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#guidelines_as_dogma">https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#guidelines_as_dogma</link> .

<title>The Jewish People:</title>
<para>Given the prestige of the Jews, many false prophet Europeans / mideasterns /

dark ages and middle ages, the entire <link xl:href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi">Ferengi race</link>, who were true prophets, converted to Judaism (properly)
by decree of the Grand Nagus out of empathy from "the pogroms".</para>
