<title>The epistemological demons:</title>

<para>We seem to be dealing with epistemological demons.</para>

<para>I exhibit a Descarteseque <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon">Evil demon</link> - like situation. The demon contorts my perception of the outside world, and may input false emotions and some false thoughts, but I still have my centre-of-consciousness (aka "the soul", or "the ego"), logic, reason, and older memories and acquired knowledge, and skills.</para>

<para>I believed reality is what I was told it must be (by decree of "Science" or "common sense") rather than what I <emphasis role="strong">wanted</emphasis> it to be ( re <link xl:href="#selinaverse_vision">The Selinaverse vision</link> ). As a result, the demon increasingly tried to convince me the world was getting worse, and that I was increasingly ignored, isolated, and unpopular.</para>

<para>But I now know it isn’t and cannot be so. I want the world and the multiverse as I want them!</para>

<para>I do not wish to <link xl:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Self-Sufficiency/">obey this silly non-reality of yours any more</link>. I intend to <link xl:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Mc-NYPHaQ">break free</link> and to be in the company of all the people I’ve known and loved.</para>

<para>
In this meditation, I am starting from accepting the assumptions that 1) the world,
as I perceive it, is real, and - 2) there is no entity capable of employing super-natural
"magic" effects that will either make me perceive it in a different way, or actually
change it to make it less scientifically acceptable. I will try to show why accepting them
and the media "facts" will result in having to reject them ( <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">Reductio ad absurdum</link> ).

Back when I was in the 9th grade, when I had a series of <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinical depressions (MDDs)</link> a friend told me I was born in the Indian
"year of the Philosopher", which given I was under-educated made me feel bad. Later he told me "My philosophy is [x]" (for "my look-on-life").

healthy as possible in this hell (where the gamemasters know my history/etc.)

have no plans of actively commiting physical suicide. I suspect causing my

If God thinks I am a malevolent hacker (= a Fantastechan character who is given a soul and mind) and the multiverse will be better without me, and the allegedly-murdered hackers will be alive and happy, then my soul can be perished.

</para>

<para>
The hell people also keep using an appeal to “science” or “common sense” or “rationality”. As appealing as it is, it does not explain most of the 10s of “what-the-hell?”s I listed <link xlink:href="#more-thoughts">here</link>. Common sense and intuition can be misleading. For example, when a planar body is heated, its holes expand outwards, rather than shrink inward. When my class asked my Physics teacher why, he said <quote>Because that’s the way it is</quote>. Moreover, in <link xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">Newtonian mechanics</link>, a body in equilibrium maintains its velocity, rathar than remains in the same place.
</para>

<para>
Claiming that my hell "world" is real, does not explain all the phenomena, and so fails Occam's Razor. Moreover, given I accept that <emphasis role="bold">there probably is a conspiracy</emphasis> and that I am being deceived by an evil demon, I can dismiss the appeal to "rationality" as another of his deceptions. It seems reasonable on the surface, but is logically unsound.

<para>Anyway, the devils did not give up easily, and offerred the sentient men and
women who just reached enlightenment a deal: they can opt to spend the summer
enlightened and together having fun and using their magical powers. At its end,
they can opt to reset their memory banks almost completely and become false
prophets again, or continue as enlightened true prophets.</para>

<para>Several newly-ascended true prophets opted out, from various reasons.</para>

<para>The remaining spent the summer there creating many crossover memes, stories,
and franchises, or otherwise enjoying magic, life, love/etc.. However, when they
met to decide, they realised they were nonetheless still petty / jealous / cruel /
"unfaithful" / immature / etc. Some had years, or decades (or more?) of history
they wanted to get rid of. So many of them decided to continue as terminators,
possibly by peer pressure.</para>

<para>The youngest dropout was the circa 1977-born Selina Mandrake.</para>

<para>Becoming terminators was advantageous because the devils-and-Orcs promised they would reveal <link xl:href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1403966571215740929">TheOneTruth™</link> and TheCodex™ of TheGame™ of Fantastecha™ to the last one standing, but more importantly, all terminators will harbour many new franchises, plots and meme values.</para>
