I know Jennifer probably feels very badly about her privacy being violated now due to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2014_celebrity_photo_leaks . I would feel the same if someone published some of my private E-mails, even if they are not sexualised. Invading one's privacy is always bad.

That put aside, here's some forward looking advice:

1. Sulk a little without feeling bad about feeling bad (see http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Moaning_Lisa ). If you feel OK about feeling bad, you'll already feel better.

2. Realise that any sexualised activity, including starring in a porn film ("XXXX..." to infinity) or selling sexual services for money (= prostitution), is neither wrong nor ever disrespectful . A woman or a man who do some of that are still a lady or a gentleman and should be respected, loved, and trusted (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shlomif/Saladin_Style#Trust_and_Respect ) and are no less of a role model. If any one did all that (including my close family) I won't think one iota less of them).

3. Tell the media that you think that #2 is right, and enjoy the publicity ( https://duckduckgo.com/?q=all%20publicity%20good%20publicity - All Publicity is Good Publicity ).

4. Be proud, stay cool and smashing and awesome, and realise that there are many people who will love you no matter what.

Finally, I invited Jennifer (or whoever wishes to come) to attend the upcoming https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICon_festival in Tel Aviv in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot and if she wants, she can contact me (I have contact info on my home page) and I'll buy her a drink or a meal. I know a very good pizza place close to the con's location, and I want to see how much pizza she can eat there on my expense. ☺

♥♥♥♥ and XOXO.
