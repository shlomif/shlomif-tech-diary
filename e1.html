<h2>2009-02-21: How I Recovered Data from a Hosed SVK Repository</h2>

<p>
Many months ago, I noticed that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVK">SVK</a>, a version control
system based on Subversion, stopped propagating changesets to the remote
Subversion repositories. Furthermore, I was unable to mirror other remote
repositories. I wrote about it here, asking for help:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/svk-users/2008-November/000380.html">Post to the svk-users mailing list</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/19585.html">My
"Problems with SVK" entry on this blog</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of this has been left unsolved until yesterday when I decided that I had
enough and wanted to finally resolve this problem. My first idea was to
try to write a script that will propagate the changesets using the Subversion
APIs, so I looked at the SVK code trying to see where exactly it happens.
I found the SVK code hard-to-follow, so I first contemplated fixing what
caused it to report an error, but was also unable to.
</p>

<p>
Then I joined the <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode IRC network</a>
and went to the #svk channel. There was only one person there who tried
to help me, and he was intermittent in helping. Then I joined #perl and casually
mentioned that I thought SVK sucked (just to lose some steam), which prompted
<a href="http://www.trout.me.uk/">mst</a> to try to help me. After
interrogating me he suggested that in order to recover the changesets from SVK,
I should follow the following steps:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Find out what is the last SVK revision which still propagated changesets to
the Subversion repository. This can be found using the commit message in the
svn log.
</li>

<li>
Revert (using a selective <tt>svnadmin dump</tt> and then an
<tt>svnadmin create</tt> ; and <tt>svnadmin load</tt>) to the older version of
<tt>~/.svk/local</tt> that corresponds with the revision number
of the commit. (While naturally keeping a copy of <tt>~/.svk/local/</tt> and
its dump in a safe place.)
</li>

<li>
See that a simple change in the svk checkout (like
<tt>svk mkdir to-delete-`date +%s`</tt>) will propagate to the remote
repository.
</li>

<li>
Revert that change using the Subversion client directly.
</li>

<li>
Revert to the working-but-old copy of the SVK repository, and apply a
filtered stream of the dumps (using <tt>svndumpfilter</tt>) that will
exclude changes from the <tt>//mirror</tt> part of the SVK repository.
</li>

<li>
After all that is done, checkout the trunk and do <tt>svk push</tt>
from there.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Of course, the devil is in the details, and it took me a lot of experimentation
until I got to something working. Facts I've discovered:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<a href="http://creatingwithcode.com/howto/extracting-projects-from-shared-svn/">svndumpfilter needs a dump that was generated without the
<tt>--deltas</tt> flag</a> (and possibly without <tt>--incremental</tt> either.
Otherwise it will complain.
</li>

<li>
I couldn't seem to do <tt>svndumpfilter exclude mirror</tt>
and instead ended up using <tt>svndumpfilter include local</tt>
</li>

<li>
The <tt>--drop-empty-revs</tt> and <tt>--renumber-revs</tt> flags to
svndumpfilter which seemed like a good idea confused <tt>svnadmin load</tt>,
and everything worked after I removed them.
</li>

<li>
Using <tt>tar -czf</tt> and <tt>tar -xf</tt> can really speed up restoring
older versions of a Subversion repository because svnadmin load is pretty slow.
</li>

<li>
I ended up taking a range of repositories from the pristine revision to "HEAD"
and then manually editing out the first revision. Maybe it was unnecessary.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
After all that "svk push" worked and propagated 800 changesets to
<a href="https://opensvn.csie.org/shlomif/homepage/trunk/">my homepage's
trunk</a> in 8:20 hours (must be a record). Since I only have an ADSL
connection with 25 KBps upstream, and the Subversion service is located in
Taiwan and I'm living in Israel, it took a while and I left it overnight
to run.
</p>

<p>
Today, after I woke up, I saw that the operation ended up successfully. I was
able to build an up-to-date version of my homesite from the Subversion sources,
and am mostly ready to ditching SVK.
</p>

<p>
Again, I'd like to thank <a href="http://www.trout.me.uk/">mst</a> for
suggesting this ultra-cool idea for recovering my data from SVK. It
took me the whole of one day, but now I'm finally free, and my data is out
there and safe. I'm going to use plain-old-Subversion to work
against it, until and assuming I'll get the hang of hg/bzr/git/whatever.
But at least I no longer have to use a mostly-unusable SVK.
</p>

<p>
Hackfully and happily yours, Shlomi Fish.
