In today's Web 2.0 Internet burning books involves censoring contrarian or blasphemous or copyright violating posts (whether text, video, audio, or whatever) - see [All great truths begin as blasphemies](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/george_bernard_shaw_101824) and burning people involves blocking them or banning them from a forum or just a subforum (=a subreddit or a chatroom or similar) instead of gently and patiently trying to educate them about how to behave better in the future (which may seem like a waste of time but actually is more constructive to the forum's growth in the long run: https://www.answers.com/Q/Where_did_the_saying_he_who_saves_a_life_save_the_world_come_from .

Often, you can get banned from forums or subforums for voicing truths that the operators did not want to hear or for violating enough rules, including unwritten ones, that were overly strictly or broadly followed. (See what I wrote [here](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/) about "hacking" and "action heroism" and big-mindedness vs. strictly following rules and orders and accepting your fate, which is usually death. ).
