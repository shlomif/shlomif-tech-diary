# Commercial Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and  ![Movie Star Wars][1]

## Summary	{#summary}

> Let’s make ("fan")-fiction great again!

(Based on [Donald Trump][2].)

This essay attributes the perceived problems of "Hollywood"/the-film-industry, namely:

* Lack of original screenplays.
* Many big-name "unemployed" actors and actresses.
* [ "Franchise fatigue"][3].
* An increase in the number of dystopian and/or pessimistic franchises and films.

To these culprits:

* The psychological, social, and economical shift towards competent and physically and intellectually attractive people being both [geeks][4] (= ["amateurs"][5]; loving their work or field of study; not doing it only for money) as well as [hackers][6] (= resourceful, rule benders, "action heroes", fate defiers).
* The recent cultural trend toward openness, freedom, sharing and [remixing][7] / [ standing on the shoulders of giants][8]. E.g: [Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)][9], [open/free content][10], ["web 2.0"][11], [User-generated content][12].
* The film industry's requirement of accepting screenplays only in its draconian, finicky (and boring) format
* Its franchise territorialism (which hinders commercial [crossovers][13]).
* The fact that copyright is enforced on commercial use of characters, concepts, and worlds (and to an extent - texts).
* The recent antagonism against [Real Person Fiction ( RPF )][14] due to an apparent "jinxing" of celebrities from being employable as actors in commercial films, and T. V. series.

It proposes a way forward, implementable by more than one party, that may hopefully make the film industry flourish just like the music industry (including "playing-for-fun" musicians), and the software industry. Here is the link to see [**the current plan and recommendations**][15].

**Note:** as a writer of fan-fiction, I may be biased in handling what seems to be the lowest-hanging fruit for me. However, I suspect this is also an important stepping stone towards other aspects of world healing.

### Disclaimer	{#disclaimer}

I am not a lawyer ( [IANAL][16] ), nor am I a qualified economist, psychologist, sociologist, historian, ethnologist, film maker, etc. Please take my insights and advice with a grain of salt.

This document is researched relatively amateurly, and it is likely that it cannot be directly cited as a reliable source. I use the HTML5 ["cite" element and attribute][17] as an origin link. Furthermore, I sometimes link or quote to older pages I originated (despite Ustinov's reluctance to do so in [the introduction to his book][18]). To be fair, I link to many other pages and also embed youtube videos.

## The Plan	{#the-plan}

OK, ok ["Show Me the Money!"][19]. Note that just like Asimov's [ Seldon Plan][20], this plan is not set in stone and [ we'll likely have to improvise ("play by ear"), or adapt it to the circumstanses][21]. Moreover, they are just guidelines and suggestions, not rules and demands. Furthermore, it is likely this will not be the final challenge faced by the film industry and fiction industry or humanity as a whole, so we should not rest on our laurels.

Anyway, I suggest:

1. Screenplay readers to also accept screenplays in easier to write and to get right formats, which should have open source, portable, and easy-to-install, validators and [linters][22]. They should also accept and tolerate some minor errors. ( [Reference][23] ).
2. Copyright owners to relicense their franchises under permissive licenses (possibly unilaterally). ( [Reference][24] ).
  * They can request to donate parts of the profits of derivative works to them.
  * > In time, Warner Bros will mismanage the [\#HarryPotter franchise][25] so badly that [@jk\_rowling][26] will be able to buy it back at a bargain price… There's another road ahead for Warner Bros, Disney, and other copyright holders than copyright cannibalism.    ( [@shlomif (= me) tweet][27] )
3. Politicians to amend the financial bylaws to allow any legal entity to transfer any amount of money to any other legal entity (possibly while keeping some digital transactions' [ledger][28]). ( [Reference][29] ).
4. Big name actors and actresses to set up production companies carrying their names. ( [Reference][30] ).
5. Start directing films with fanfic: crossovers, [Real Person Fiction ( RPF )][31], parodies, etc.
6. 1. Film / TV shows / etc. copyright owners should avoid trying to [stamp out piracy][32]. In addition, legitimate low-res (720p/etc.) versions of the complete films and TV show episodes should be provided free of charge on YouTube/etc. This is for hyperlinking, making [image macros][33], video macros, meme scenes, meme story arcs, or even watching completely.> The second big element of Web 2.0 is democracy. We now have several examples to prove that amateurs can surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to channel their efforts. Wikipedia may be the most famous. Experts have given Wikipedia middling reviews, but they miss the critical point: it’s good enough. And it’s free, which means people actually read it. On the web, articles you have to pay for might as well not exist. Even if you were willing to pay to read them yourself, you can’t link to them. They’re not part of the conversation.    ( [Paul Graham: "Web 2.0"][34]. )
  2. Content copyright owners are advised to stop sending [takedown notices][35] against infringing copies (or web resources suspected as such.)
  3. Similarly most forms of [DRM][36] provide [fig leaf protection][37] at best and are often obstacles for legitimate uses, and so are best avoided.
