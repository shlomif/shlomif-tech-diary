Thanks for your criticism.

Regarding "sexism", I said "tended" and it was said given my traditional (as of 2021) perception of how (in general) women handle such situations differently than men. There are outliers for both genders naturally. I don't know the reasons for them - they could be biological/genetic, cultural, educational, psychological, etc. Nonetheless, I believe they have affected the men and women on the sets because they were late 20th century-born and couldn't transcend their own time.

Do note that Whedon "err"ed on that as well. [Xena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xena), as awesome as she was, was the kind of female warrior who could kill tens of enemies without caring (and in the real world, would have long ago gotten herself killed by a missile - see the [David and Goliath motif](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/david_and_goliath.xhtml) ). On the other hand, Buffy ( and later Faith ) were realistic and vulnerable and found their situation as protectors of humanity from the demonic underworld increasingly aggravating (e.g: https://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/mhz0hq/buffys_depression_arc_is_a_serieslong_thing/ ).

( Do note that men are not long-term immune to destruction of values too. E.g: recently Apple tried to stop sales of competing mobile devices and even though it had milliards of dollars in the bank ran out of lawyers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone_patent_wars . It is for Apple's and everyone's else's good anyway. )

I'll address your other points in subsequent replies.
