Getting Street Fighter 2 Up and Running in MAME (on Linux)
==========================================================

Run `sudo apt -y install mame` (or equivalent on non-Debian-derivatives).
Look at `less /etc/mame/mame.ini` and note the `rompath` line, e.g:

.rompath
[source]
----
rompath                 $HOME/mame/roms;/usr/local/share/games/mame/roms;/usr/share/games/mame/roms
----

The important path for us is the one under `$HOME` (i.e `$HOME/mame/roms` in our case).

Now go to this page: https://www.romsformame.com/index.php?a=342 , press the "Download
game" link and place `sf2ce.zip` in your home directory.

Now copy it to the ROMs' path:

.As user commands:
[source,sh]
----
$ mkdir -p ~/mame/roms
$ cp ~/sf2ce.zip ~/mame/roms
$ mame sf2ce
----

Note that currently the only keyboard key that appears to work is "Escape", which
quits MAME.

.Type this to run the game again.
[source,sh]
----
mame sf2ce
----
