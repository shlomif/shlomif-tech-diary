<p>
This is a review of <a href="http://framework.metasploit.com/">Metasploit
Framework</a> version 3.0. I've decided to download it so I can try to intrude
into my home network's Windows machines, to see how they secure they are.
</p>

<p>
After unpacking the archive one gets a directory called
"<tt>framework-3.0</tt>", without the metasploit branding. There is no further
version indication, but I noticed that the directory tree of the framework
downloaded a few months ago was identical to that of the one downloaded now.

<p>
The documentation is in PDF format (with some sources available in LaTeX
format).
