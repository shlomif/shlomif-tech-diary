http://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/buffy-is-not-a-nobody.mkv - Buffy is not a nobody - she is "Buffy, the vampire slayer" and she can kick some serious demonic ass.

For the impatient or disabled here's the transcript quoting from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_%28Buffy_episode%29 - under CC-by-sa / GFDL:

<<<
Ken lines the captives up and each one is asked, "Who are you?" and then bludgeoned unless they answer "I'm no one." Buffy realizes this is where the muttering old people on the street have come from. When it's her turn to be asked who she is, she says her name with pride and kicks the demon who asked. She rouses the rest of the captives to fight back and a battle ensues. She's finally stopped as Ken holds Lily at knifepoint. He then delivers a speech about how they're all stuck and will die there, until Lily, who has been passive until now, pushes Ken off a ledge onto the concrete floor. Lily then leads the captives back up through the "pool" as Buffy dispatches Ken, and once all of the humans are out of the demonic dimension, the pool gateway between the dimensions closes.

Now here's my study and philosophising on it:

---------------------------------------

You are not a nobody. You are special. You are unique. You are an individual. You are [insert your name or nickname here]! You are a great and wonderful and a beautiful person. And you too can kick some serious ass, change the world for the better, become the most powerful man or woman on Earth , and the Messiah and help bring the End of Days. And it's not farfetched.

You don't have to know martial arts. You can be unemployed, or even homeless. You can be a waitor or a waitress at restaurant. You can be a prostitute. You may be a professional ballerina trainee (one of the last remaining artforms where many people believe that professional performers and artists are better than amateur and polymath ones). You may be a smoker or an alcoholic or a drug abuser. You may be stuck in some apparently nowhere place and have very low aspirations (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook ). You may have a mental illness. Hell, you may have even murdered or mass murdered many people.

But you're a human being and you're not negligible and there is a reason you were born and you can become noble and wonderful and a superhero.

Whenever someone tells me that I'm "a noone", "a nobody", "a loser", "not special", "a small cog in the system" , "another brick in the wall" , etc. I will tell them "No, I'm not. I am Shlomi Fish (a.k.a "Rindolf"), the Little Red Riding Hood of Messiahs. Nice to meet you. Now please tell me who are you, and a little or a lot about yourself. Let's be friends." (see  http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/the-eternal-jew/#reception for some of the context).

With some persistence, some belief in yourself, and the understanding that you need to bend the rules sometimes (see http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath ), and that you constantly need to improve yourself (*NEVER* rest on your laurels) and your skills, become inspired, and synergetically help and be helped by other people, you too can be a superheroic person.

Note: this is not about being the 1st place. You may not win the Nobel Prize (or the Pulitzer Prize, or the Fields Medal, or the Turing Award or whatever), you may not get the most views on YouTube, you may not have the most Stackoverflow or Reddit rep, you may not be the No. 1 spot on the Billboard songs, you may not take the No. 1 place in the Olympics or win the Superbowl, but it doesn't mean that if you lose, you're not a winner. Not everyone wins that, but those who don't try or don't try to improve are the real losers.

---------

If you want to change the world make yourself and possibly at least one other person happier today: but something small at a local shop and have a friendly conversation with the seller; tell a joke to someone; chat with someone who walks on the street with a dog about his dog and about him; write a silly and/or amusing and/or insightful post on your blog/Twitter/Facebook/Google+/whatever ; brainstorm new Chuck Norris facts (or Summer Glau facts or Emma Watson facts or whoever else you want to praise, including your family member) on a chat network or [better yet] in the real world; compliment someone for his look, his cooking, his intelligence, his wisdom, or anything else he or she does well; write and publish a new piece of crazy crossover "fan fiction", which not everyone may get all of its subtleties but a lot of people will enjoy ("fan fiction" is placed here in quotes because most of the stories in the Old Testament and most of Aesop's fables were also fan fiction which was attributed to them); improve something you already did to make it a little more perfect by being a little less imperfect; buy a beggar a meal or pay him some money to have an inspiring talk that brings good luck; give some money to a street performer and talk with him. Comment on a YouTube video you liked. Etc. etc. - whatever makes you and other people happy.

Live, smile and be happy for being awesome and alive.

A lot of people claim that there's going to be a new bubble, or that the world is going to chaos. But hoping and expecting the worst is a poor way to live. I'm planning to improve the world and help prevent a new https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kondratiev_wave from happening, because people have been predicting a burst of the bubble for years.

Who is our common enemy for which we must stand united? It's not Microsoft. It's not Walt Disney Corp. It's not the U.S. Governemt. It's not even Enthropy. It is what Neo-Tech (= a very interesting and inspiring Neo-Objectivist idea system that unfortunately suffered from being a little too much cultistic, dogmatic, and paranoid) calls "Mysticism"  which is: 1. The belief that man-willed and negative realities will take place instead of the real, objective, commonly-shared reality out there. and - 2. The creation of problems where none exist instead of solving problems where they do.

And back to Buffy (â™¥), the first three seasons of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer were, despite incredible pretension to the contrary the almost complete antithesis of Mysticism. Only, it wasn't 100% perfect and the show unfortunately went downhill from there.

And here's the thing: the Aristotlean writings claim that good things should have a beginning, a middle and an end. Many hardcore geeks complained that their favourite shows of science fiction, fantasy, geekdom, etc. get cancelled or reach an ending, etc. but that's the essence of a good saga of fiction: it ends. The current series which are in vogue among geeks will also probably end: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory ; and even https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic (which I'm also a big fan of and even found of practical utility). But life will go on, there'll be a lot of fan fiction and crossovers, and new shows will spring up instead.

Now that I look at Buffy's fighting in that scene, I'm amazed at how much she faught in an amateuristic and improvisational way. But that's the thing: amateurs can be better and more likeable than the pros, because they love what they do. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie (who is a truly inspiring person despite being 1994 born and only 20 years old as of now) started her YouTube videoblog first with blogging about computer games, and then by preparing poor quality videos of her covering many popular songs). But she was persistent, self-critical and humble, constantly sought to improve herself, seized most opportunities for fame, was grateful to her fans and supporters, and became better, until she's now a pro and a big star. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYX8sjIzjGw .

The main manifestation of mysticism around today is red tape: lots of positively lazy bureaucrats, law makers, and many well-intentioned accountants and lawyers who prevent real productive people, companies and other organisations,  from getting shit's done and [possibly] getting the money they deserve. For example, I'd love to donate money to Twitter or Reddit unconditionally (without buying stock or shares) because they provide a wonderful service. And from what I understood the French law allows commercial companies to accept donations.

As post-Modernism slowly but surely enough gives way to the scary-but-incredibly exciting New Age, we are encountering many questions (see http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#machines_that_can_give_questions ) about whether what we did in the past was OK then and now is no longer needed, because we and our times are better. We may need to consider whether each and every one of our laws and our taboos is really needed.

You can change, and you can change society, and I believe no one is negligible. The world history was far from being perfect, but I don't want to have been born in a world where https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith or even Hitler, Mao, Stalin, Genghis Khan, Atilla the Hun - there I said that -, etc. were not alive.

Thanks to these people, the powers of good are smarter, stronger, more ingenious, and more honest, than the powers of mysticism which are becoming weaker of mysticism which are becoming more marginal. Geeks/hackers/action-heros/etc. come in many different shapes and sizes (see

Mysticism has some variety but it's usually just cynical, skeptical and almost always - wrong. We all have a little bit of cynicism and mysticism, but we should battle it and come out victorious. And no matter how much your life has screwed you over, these two fine ladies proved that you can still become a superhero:
