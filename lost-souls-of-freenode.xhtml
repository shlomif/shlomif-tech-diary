<h1>The Lost Souls of Freenode</h1>

<pre>
* "Many Lost Souls" on Freenode's #perl - IM conversation.
* Quote the conversation about "First rule of #perl channels".

* People having problems getting indentation right.

* People who /msg me after asking.
    - Either they think that's the way to answer.
    - Or they think that I cannot help them because there's another
    conversation.
    - They're usually not willing or cannot afford to pay.
    - Someone who thought that paying me 50 USD / hour for private help
    was too high.

* People who want us to write their code for them.

* “Help me with a script I found.”
    - Often badly written.

* “Help me with using a program / my operating system / etc.”
    - Not even related to coding.

* “Are you using version control?” “No, what's that?”
- Automated tests?
- A debugger?

* Old versions of perls.

* Homework/scholastic constraints.
- “We didn't study it yet”
- “No external modules / CPAN”
- “Not allowed to any built-in language data structures, including not arrays.”
    - Mandatory course.
    - Graded 0 once because was programmed on Python-2.7.x and tested on
    Python-3.3.x (on Windows).

* One who didn't know what files are nor did file I/O.
- Ruby
- private conversation with someone else who didn't know what files are.
