<h1>The Lost Souls of Freenode</h1>

<p>
I originally wanted to written a more prose-like blog post about the topic of
“The Lost Souls of Freenode”, echoing some of my frustrations
from trying to help people on <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>
channels, especially <code>#perl</code> and <code>##programming</code> and
I started from keeping a list of bullets and sub-bullets and decided to keep
it this way out of being lazy. Maybe it can also be considered the blog
equivalent of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiHow">wikiHow</a>
pages.
</p>

<p>
After I gave a link to the bullets to someone I met on Freenode, he told
me he hasn't found any of what he read here surprising from his experience
on IRC and as a tutor and T.A. (= Teacher Assistant) in an American college.
</p>

<p>
“Many Lost Souls” on Freenode's #perl - IM conversation.

conversation</a> about “First rule of #perl channels” (meaning that Freenode’s
#perl is our first line of defence).

<li>Or they think that I cannot help them because there's another
    conversation.</li>
<li>They're usually not willing or cannot afford to pay.</li>
<li>Someone who thought that paying me 50 USD / hour for private help
    was too high.</li>
