* The current situation is that I am stuck in a hell mouth: I have a strong mind
that is getting sharper and kinder. My father has a strong body, but is spending
a lot of time on financial/political struggles that bring him little monetary
benefit if at all, and deprive him of happiness and time. Moreover, he keeps
making up arbitrarry rules for me to behave outside that deprive me of
joy and interacting with people of strong souls.
