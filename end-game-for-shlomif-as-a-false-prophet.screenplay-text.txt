Sayeret Matkal [male] soldier #1: Greetings Dr. Fish. Private Foo and I are
Sayeret Matkal soldiers escorting and protecting Ms. Emma Watson, Mr. Rindolf
"Womanhands" the Dwarf, and Ms. Christina Grimmie. Please let us in, and summon
your son, Mr. Shlomi Fish.

Shlomi: [steps forwards looks ] hi guys.

Christina Grimmie: hey, Shlomi. [points a light gun at Shlomi not unlike <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/Summer-Glau-Two-Guns-Photo/">these</a>]

+++: I can kill you now, but I won't. Consider yourself slain and reborn.

+++: just for the record, I'm Christina Grimmie, this is strudel-EmmaWatson,
and this is Rindolf "womanhands" the Dwarf.

Shlomi: I'm glad you're alive Chrisâ€¦ I'm glad everyone is.

[ Shlomi and Christina hug each other. Either or both shed tears. ]

[ Shlomi <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBN77b4P39s">does the Chinese
"(you're my) master"</a> gesture towards Grimmie. She does the same towards him,
and the other four or five hackers. ]
