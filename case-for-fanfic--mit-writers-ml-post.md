I've been working on my latest masterpiece effort - possibly not the last one
in accordance to this Jessie J song -
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTOFEgJ9zzI ("Masterpiece"). Titled "Commercial
Real Person Fan Fiction (RPFs), crossovers and parodies as 2021 geek/hacker
imperatives for revitalising the film industry" or
"The Case for Commercial Fanfic" for short:

It involves some fictional writing too.

Reflecting on my 2014 discussion on this list with Veganne:

* It seems that almost all attractive females are both geeky (= "amateurs") and
hackers by now. This has jinxed the reality show "Beauty and the Geek", whose
Israeli 2nd season sported completely unattractive female contestants, and
whose 3rd season didn't happen. More recently, big budget Hollywood films were
similarly jinxed because attractive actors and actresses, whether experienced,
big name or budding, refused to play for badly written films even for
all the money in the world (being amateurs):

* The Bible had hyperlinks of sorts:

* Illustrations in stageplays were common in the 19th century:

This book was illustrated too:

* Fanfiction / crossovers / RPFs are a logical step in the "open / remix"
culture ("standing on the shoulders of giants"):
