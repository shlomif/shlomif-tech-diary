Great post. I found it amusing. Good luck with Nanowrimo.

You asked where I get my inspiration from. Well, <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/2736.html">I told the story about the sources of inspiration for my first novella "The Enemy and How I Helped to Fight it" on a blog post</a> that I wrote about 3 or 4 years back. Here's <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TheEnemy/">the direct link to "the Enemy" story</a> as it appears on my homepage, as both the Hebrew original and a translation I prepared to English.

Regarding <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOWTF/">the One with the
    Fountainhead</a>, it's a funny thing. I originally got the idea for the
skeleton of the story when I went out to jog, slightly before and while I
jogged. I think I drew a lot of inspiration for combining "The Fountainhead"
and the "Friends" T.V. show from the web parody
<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/hitchhiker-guide-to-star-trek-tng.html">"The
    Hitchhiker's Guide to Star Trek - The Next Generation"</a> which I had read
much earlier. After I was settled on parodying The Fountainhead using a Friends
episode, the story and its elements more or less flowed. I can recall some
other inspirations, like when I've seen in several movies that when people got
stranded on deserted islands and wrote "HELP!" on the shore, I thought to
myself why they didn't also write
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS">S.O.S.</a> and inscriptions in
other languages, which became part of the screenplay.

<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/humanity/">My screenplay
    "Humanity"</a> was based on a movie which I hallucinated to have been
filmed at a time during a long period of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania">Mania</a> (very unpleasant,
I know), when my brain was working extra hours on various delusions. I did not
picture the entire movie as is, only a few scenes, and some scenes were added
later from other inspirations. <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">"We, the Living Dead"</a> is also based on my delusions from that time, but it took me several years to figure out a way to write them while being mostly faithful to the Star Trek frenchise on which it was based.

I suppose I can go on, but I'd rather not.

Lately I realised that I have a little problem with inspiration when it comes to writing my stories and screenplays. Often I leave gaping holes in the story or screenplay and write some other text towards the end, or leave it alone for weeks or even months at a time, and then write down some other text. Sometimes, I write filler text for the stories that just continue the text from a place I went up to, and these fillers are written on the fly without an inspiration proper, but are still often amusing or at least interesting.

On the other hand, I almost never lack inspirations for my essays and articles (which are sometimes blog posts) and instead sometimes lack the patience or time to work on them and actually write them. (In a 99% perspiration sort of thing).

So thanks again for providing the inspiration for me to write this blog comment. I might post it on <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/">my non-tech blog</a>.
