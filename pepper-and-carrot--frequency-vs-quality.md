After talking to someone on net chat, he mentioned that he had visited P&amp;C and liked it, he got tired waiting for new episodes and forgot about it. But "why can't we have both?": continue the narration using a more quick-to-prepare style and later rework some of them using the more quality (and slower) style. and I should note that "a man who crosses a river twice will cross two different rivers". I didn't write <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/29205258">Selina Mandrake</a> around 2011-2013 like I originally envisioned it in 1997-1998, and would write it differently today. I expect even "less" of other people who parody, adapt and/or remake someone else's work.
