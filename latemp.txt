[url=http://web-cpan.berlios.de/latemp/]Latemp[/url] (a play on "Template" and a pun on LaTeX) is an off-line content management system that I created based on some [url=http://thewml.org/]Website Meta Language[/url] code that I hacked for several of my sites, and then merged the commonalities into one integrated whole.

You are probably familiar with many online content management systems: blog engines such as WordPress, Movable Type, or Typo, wikis such as MediaWiki, Oddmuse wiki,  MoinMoin or PmWiki, and grand-unified online CMSes such as Plone, Drupal or Joomla. What is common to all of them is that they run on the server and render their pages on the fly on almost every request. This has some advantages, but naturally also overloads and slows-down the server, and requires keeping the server CMS code up-to-date, free of bugs, spam, and other attacks. (see for example the [url=http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2009/09/07/wordpress-worm-requires-upgrade-to-2-8-4/]recent WordPress worm[/url]).

So what makes Latemp different? It is an [b]offline[/b] content management system. One uses it on one's workstation machine to process the templates and data, and render them into a tree of pages - either static HTML ones or alternatively mostly HTML ones that contain embedded code in such text-embedded languages as PHP, [url=http://www.masonhq.com/]HTML-Mason[/url], etc. (I admit I haven't tried the latter option yet but it should be doable with some effort). The result - a web-site like [url=http://www.shlomifish.org/]my home-site[/url] which contains a unified look and feel, several navigation menus, a breadcrumbs trail, navigation links and almost entirely valid HTML/XHTML markup (report any problems to me, and I'll see what I can do), with close to full control over the resultant HTML.

If you want to play with Latemp, you'll need to install its dependencies (quite a few of them, but it's not that hard), and then run latemp-setup -h to get something basic working. Alternatively, you can start from one of the [url=http://web-cpan.berlios.de/latemp/examples/]example sites[/url], and try to learn from it. There is some documentation for the various dependencies, but it may lack a good tutorial.

Anyway, Latemp proved to be a very useful tool for me: I'm able to maintain large, complex and yet consistent and valid sites, that run quickly (my homepage already withstood at least two slashdottings without a hitch), do not cause me a lot of security concerns, and are a joy to work on. While there are many things I would only be able do with some server-side scripting, I still feel that http://www.shlomifish.org/ , http://perl-begin.org/ and other Latemp sites fulfill their purpose and as I do not desire them to be world-editable.

There are naturally some other offline CMSes besides Latemp, and there are many custom ones or hacked ones (and like I said Latemp started from some copy-and-pasted back and forth boilerplate I wrote using Website Meta Language, that I eventually merged and released). Even with all the Web 2.0 / wikis / blogs / etc. frenzy, I still think good ol' static HTML has its place.

So let me know what you think.
